has the long vowel in arai and that of dactylic verse,
quite differently posited.

Tutior for ocyor is ingenious, and unquestionably im-
proves the te‘xt by the idea of sqfety. But the extent of
the Poet's fame demands the reading notior, which 1 have
preferred. The whole tenor of that and the following
stanna beautifully corresponds with it.

17, 18, 19. Me Colchus ..........
et ultimi
Noscent Geloni.

So too,

 

A. P. 345, 6. Hic meret aera liber Sosiis: hii: et mare transit,
Et longum noto scriptori prorogat aevum.

Again, the common reading,

3 C. xlv. 11. —-—- male ominatis Ι Parcite verbis.

has been with some plausibility defended. I have here
followed Bentley, but doubtingly‚ I confess, in hisv
emendation.

. . . . male inominatis Ι Parcite verbis.

Once more,

3 C. v. 17, 18. Si non periret immiserabilis
Captiva pubes. . . .

Glareanus (now 300 years ago) saw with just intuition
the fault of this text, that it wants the 5th syllable long;
and- his emendation of perirent, as farther improved by
Bentley's immiserabiles, 1 have cheerfully adopted.

All the instances adduced to support periret in that posi·
tion are foreign to the purpose, either like one of several,
the first here quoted,

3 C. xvr. 26. Quicquid arat impiger Appulus,
