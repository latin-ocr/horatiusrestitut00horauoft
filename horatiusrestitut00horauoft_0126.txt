(102) APPEanx 1.

Pressa tuis balanus capillis
Jamdudum apud me est. . . .

where for once his invitation includes choice wine, garlands
of roses, and unguents of exquisite odom, such articles as
never occur in like manner mentioned elsewhere.

The lines next quoted from the Epistle serve incidentally
to shOW, that Horace for that year at least staid in the city
over the birth-day of the Great J ulius; then observed as a
dies festus by cessation from business and affording oppor-
tunity in its eve for a longer night of cheerfulness than his
friend the lawyer could otherwise have enjoyed. The day
itself (F. H. Β. c. 100) fell on the 12th of July, quarto
vIdus Quintiles : and on the preceding evening the sun
would set at Rome nearly at seven o'clock of our reckoning.
This particular may here deserve notice, if it be only to
introduce one remark 3 that as the natural or solar day with
them was divided into twelve hours (from the 1st to the
x11th) of different length at different seasons, I may be ex-
cused in trusting to the intelligence of the reader for more
exact calculation, whenever in these pages the Roman hour
is assumed generally as answering to our own, on the well
known scale, at the time of the Equinox.

Libra die somnique pares ubi fecerit horas.
Geo. i. 208.

The remaining lines of the Epistle sufficiently exemplify
that charin of the mundae pauperum coenae‚ superadded to
the more essential taste in selecting a party of congenial
spirits3 which to the humble triclinium of Horace, neat but
narrOW, (such the lecti of Archias's making seem to have
been‚) must have imparted a peculiar atu-action, beyond the

purchase of luxury and opulence.
