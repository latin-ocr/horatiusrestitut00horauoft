grandson Caius, B. c. 1.; and of course long before any itu·
putation whatever could have been cast on his public or hit
private integrity.

The vindication of Lollius from certain calumnies, for
which no pretence cari be found before the period when as
the tutor of the young Prince he incurred the hatred of
Tiberius, Ι have with great care and perhaps not without
success* undertaken in the Gentleman's Magazine‚· May,
1834, under the title of Vindieiae Lolliam.

The two passages of Velleius Paterculus and one of the
Elder Pliny, on which alone those calumnies are founded,
are in that article produced and subjected to severe examin-
ation. Of any fact or even hint in disparagement of
Lollius's character, neither in Tacitus nor in Suetonius,
does one historica] vestige appear; while of Velleius's base-
ness in flattering the bad passions of Tiberius, proofs and
testimonies are brought forward enough to satisfy any rea-
sonable demand.

And 1 am strangely mistaken if Horace himself, not-
withstanding the honours paid to the “Major Neronum''
(4 C. x1v. 14.) in his best days (egregius vita famaque quoad
privatus vel in imperiis sub Augusto fuit. Ann. v1. 51.) did
not owe a very marked suppression of his name to that very
Ode in praise of Lollius which we are now considering. To
what cause, indeed, so probable as Tiberian malignity deeply
operating, may the following fact be attributed? ’

In Velleius's catalogue of Roman Poets, L. 11. c. 36,
ᾧ ξ 2, 3, thessnames of Lucretius, Catullus, Virgil, Tibullus,
and Naso, are all prominently paraded z—that of Horace is
not visible!

Could this striking omission then be the result of mere
¹ oversight, with such immense chauces in calculation against
it? or is it not naturally accounted for at once, by suppos-
ing it a sacrifice to the dark disgust of Tiberius's eye?
