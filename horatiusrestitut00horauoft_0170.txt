we clearly gather that an occasional excursion to Venusia
in his younger days would eost him very little trouble,
when even some twenty years afterwards he records his in-
tention (l Ε. xv.) to ride as far as Velia or Salernum : and
the very phrase videas, if that necessarily implies personal
observation on the spot, rather than knowledge from report
which might reach him at Rome, by no means involves in
it any assertion equivalent to that which the words nuper
vidi would express. “

Then for the Fountain of Bandusiae—*If that Ode had
been written on occasion of such a visit so paid‚ in the very
spot where his playful childhood was passed, would the man
have quite forgotten the boy, and totally forborne the least
allusion to his early reminiscences? An idea like this
horders on the impossible; more especially with Horace,
who has so minutely recorded whatever else belonged to the
history of his boyhood. Such and so unaccountable then
is the Poet's silence about himself and his childish days, if
the Fountain which he has thus canonised, had its local
habitation and its name in the neighbourhood of Venusia
only; while, in aid of that negative argument, every local
circumstance otherwise known in the picture of Horace's
Sabine Villa and the fine spring of water unquestionably ad-
joining it, vividly corresponds with the scenery exhibited in

of Tivoli‚ be allowed to have been written many years before
he ever dwelt there3 another objection in a different quartel-
