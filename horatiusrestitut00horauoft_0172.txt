as the brief but faithful statement here given may serve to
exemplify.

M. Sanadon, in the Nouvelle Distribution, comprises his
first book of Odes (made up of 18 Odes and 2 Epodee)
within the 25th and 31 st years of Horace, a space of seven
years: Dr. Kirchner in his arrangement scatters those 20
pieces over twenty-four years, that is, between the years
26 and 49 of Horace's life, placing two, and. two only, of
the whole number, within thelimits assigned to them⁴ by M..
Sanadon. · ’ ⁴

Here then are two scholars by profession, evidently men
of erudition and talem, labouring with all diligencc to illus<
'trate de novo the life and writings of Horace. And what is
the result? At first setting out they so far agree as to
throw down and forsake the old landmarks of that division
into books, which from the earliest age is known to have
existed: and when, von returning from their respective dis-
coveries, the report of the German is contrasted with that
of the French adventurer‚ from the first specimen of com-
parison‚ what else are we naturally led to conclude, but
that one of them cannot have gone right, most likely from
the chauces of error that they both have gone wrong ?

If, however, after all, any person should feel inclined to
form on fuller examination his own judgment of their re-
spective merits, the volumes of Sanadon are to be found in
the British Museum; and a copy of the Qnaes‘rronsss
HonATIANAE‘ of Kirchner is now placed there 011 purpose,
that the whole treatise, and particularly his Tabula Chr&
nologica Horatiana, or balance sheet, may be at any time
⁴ inspeeted‚
