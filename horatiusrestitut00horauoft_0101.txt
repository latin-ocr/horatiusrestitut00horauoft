Horace's temper, in truth‚ was that of the most happy
conte'ntedness and gratitude. In the Satire, 1 S. v1. Hoc
erat in votis. . . . when the· man of letters, (being ene, as he
calls himself, 230. xvn. 29, Mercurialium virorum‚) puts
up his prayer to Mercury, v, 5, Maia nate. . . .as to his
patron God,

ν. 15. -—-—— utque soles, cuseos mihi maximus adsis ‚-

he invokes the pati-onage on this one condition,

v. 13. Si quod adest, yratum juvat„ .

that for his present blessings he is truly grateful. And in

a passage also of a much later date, otherwise remarkable
sor its moral beauty, that point is distinctly put forward.

At an early period the bounty of Maeeenas had made him
abundantly rich, with an understood readiness at any time
to give more, if more should be needed.

Nec, si plura velim, tu dare deneges.

And even the concluding words of the Ode last quoted——

 

Bene est, cui Deus obtulit
Parca quod satis est manu.
