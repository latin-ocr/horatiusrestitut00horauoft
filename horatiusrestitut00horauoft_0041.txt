’ What is the remark of Baxter on this passage ?

“ 15. Bene labentis equo .· nam Parthorum pugna fere
erat equestris. Apposuit autem ista, quo gratificaretur
Augusto, ob recepta signa Marco Crasso adempta.”

Anachronism and confusion like this might be expected⁴
from Baxter. One may wonder that the cautious and
· accurate Gesner should interpose no correction of it. But
neither is he found always faithful to his qualified declaration
of agreement with Bentley.

Hoc certe confirmare possum, me, dum recenseo singulas
Eclogas, diligenter attendisse, si quid esset Bentleianis tem-
porum rationibus adversum, nec deprehendisse quidquam,
quod momentum aliquod ad eam evertendam haberet; licet
quibusdam Eclogis non improbabili ratione forte tempus
etiam aliud, recentius praesertim, possit adscribi.

The clearness of view which arises from placing the
Satires before the Epodes, and the Epodes before the Odes,
cannot be denied. The advantage to be derived from
Bentley's arrangement in placing the 4th book of Odes after
the lst book of Epistles‚ may not perhaps be quite so
evident. One example or two will serve to show the im-
portauce of that distribution.

There is an intellectual as well as a linear perspective.
And some space for time and thought must be allowed
to intervene: or in the case of great moral and political
changes taking place, without the aid of that interval,
very often all the probabilities of expectation will be
shocked. Thus, if seven or eight years are considered to
elapse betwixt the average date of the 3d book of Odes
and the publication of the 4th; even in the omens of
moral improvement displayed in the latter we shall see
nothing extravagant‚ in those of political alteration we shall
see the highest credibility. ¹
