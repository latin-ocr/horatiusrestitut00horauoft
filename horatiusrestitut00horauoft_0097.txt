tribute of fame which a Poet of such talent might confer,
carries with it every reasonable evidence of truth, as to the
origin of the Poems alluded to.

Scripta quidem ejus usque adeo probavit, mansuraque
perpetuo opinatus est, ut non modo Saeculare carmen com-

Drusique privignorum suorum ; eumque coegerit propter
hoc, tribus Carminum Libris ex lonyo intervallo quartum
addere.

Other considerations too may here deserve our regard.
The very mixture of articles, in matter certainly baser, if
not in execution, compared with so much magnificence in
Α the principal Odes of the 1vth book, is enough to indicate
something extraordinary. In the few words of Gesner in-

some two or three years after that date.

Need 1 here bestow a moment's notice on the pomp and
conceit with which, out of various lyric pieces of the Poet,
Sanadon, and after him Anchersen, have arbitrarily con-
structed a drama quoddam saeculare of their own. J ustly,
yet mildly enough, is their audacious absurdity, in thus
