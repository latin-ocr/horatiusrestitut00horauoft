(34) PnEmmNARY DISSERTATION.

 

quae deserta et inhospita tesqua
Credis, amoma vocat, mecum qui sentit ......

(4.) Horace had a way of his own, an oblique way of
mentioning sources of anxiety or objects of ambitious desire
in other men, from which he considered himself fortunately
free.

Thus in a passage of· the lst Epode, to Maecenas, Ibis
Liburnis inter alta navium, &a in which he so tendet-ly
begs as his companion to share the dangers of the ensuing
war (called Actian from its issue); he declares his heart to
be influenced by honest affection alone, by no speculation of
splendid reward.

vv. 23 -30. Libenter hoc et omne militabitur

Bellum in tuae spem gratiae ς

Non ut juvencis illigata pluribus
Aratra nitantur meis,

Pecusve Calabris ante sidus fervidum
Lucana mutet pascua3

Nec ut superni villa candens Tusculi
Circaea tangat moenia.

It will hardly be believed, that instead of seeing in 'these
rlines a disavowal of any wish for wealth and splendor,
some critics have found in the two last the fancied enlarge-
ment of a magnificent villa at Tusculum which Horace
'already possessed there! Chaupy‚ Vol. 11. pp. 262, 3.
with great acuteness sets this matter in its true light.

’ Let us take another instance.

⁶ Horace in a moody and wayward humour, real or affected,
1 E. v111. Celso qaudere, ὅτε. instructs the Muse thus to
'‘answer if Celsus Albinovanus should inquire about him ε

 

, dic, multa et pulchra minantem,
Vivere nec recte nec suaviter3 haud quia grando
Contuderit vites, oleamve momorderit aestus,

Nec quia lonqinquis armentum aegrotet in agris ’ς
Sed quia mente minus validus, διο. &c.
