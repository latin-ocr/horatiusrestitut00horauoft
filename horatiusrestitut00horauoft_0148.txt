vv. 17, 18. Nuper solicitum quae mihi taedium,
Nunc desiderium curaque non levis,

sufficiently indicate, that during the years of civil discord
he had known only distress and anxiety, while in the calm
repose which he now might enjoy, the deepest affections of
his heart found their natural anchorage. Nor can Ι deny
the tribute of assent and admiration to Sanadon's mode of
interpreting,

vv. 11, 12. ‘Quamvis Pontica pinus,
Sylvae filia nobilis,

in reference to the Trojan origin of Roman glory; while by
the line,

v, 10. Non Dii quos iterum pressa voces malo,

Horace beautifully intimateS, that after such repeated mer-
cies nothing more could now be expected, if they would
venture out to sea again.

Thus far then we deny any-thing whatsoever like adula-
tion to Augustus Caesar, or political apostacy, in the writings
of Horace. On the other hand, while no proof exists of
deep and remarkable attachment ever cherished to the party
of Brutus, it is gratifying to observe, that, so long as the
remembrance of Philippi retained any freshness about it,
Horace not only abstains from any hint of reprobation
thrown upon the cause itself, (in fact he never did so reflect
upon it‚) but speaks in the most guarded and delicate man· '
ner, where the mention of that name might have suggested
a compliment to Augustus as the leader of a party.

Sensi, relicta non bene parmula ς
Cum fracta virtus, et minaces
Turpe solum tetigere mento.
