(188) ou riu: narnus οι· nonnus

The following from Horace,

1 C. xxvx. ll. Hunc Lesbio Ι sacrare plectro. .

2 C. 1‘11.‘27; ‘S6rsexit6ra et nos in aeternum. . . ²

not only differ in the words and in the accentuation' fi‘o'mss¹
those of Buchanan, but are two forms of the verse in the*
first and second *books which in the third and fourth never
appear again: Horace has branded them as illegitimate.

10. Nor may this verse, according to his maturer taste
decisively shown, terminate with one quadrisyllabic or with
two dissyllabic words,

The form ¹

l C. xx1x. Pronos relabi Ι posse l rivos. . .

which occurs eight times in the first and second books, and'
the form ’ ’

2 C· anx. 19. Nodo coerces Ι viperino. .

which occurs three times in those books, are both of them
repudiated entirely from the third and fourth. ”

By parity of reason, a trisyllabic word with an enclitic,
as que or ve, or other monosyllable, must be excluded also.
And on this peculiar string (it is remarked in the Preface
to the Musae Etonenses) Sarbievius has erred, but in one
instance only.

4 Lyric. 1. 55. Paeana dicit, Ι supplicesque. .

And here let us observe, 'that the-entire rejection by Ho-
race of any modes of structure in his later books which were
rare even in his earlier, must( have quite escaped the notice
of grammar-iaus. To their ignorance in teaching, therefore,
may partly be imputed the gross errors committed by mo-
dern Latin writers; who would hardly have gone so *far
wrong in defiance of their great model, if they had heeli
rightly instructed first of all, or if they had looked up to Ho-
race as their only legitimate exemplar afterwards. ·More
