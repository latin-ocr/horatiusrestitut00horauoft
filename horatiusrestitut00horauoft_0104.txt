One more association shall serve to connect the mention
of Maecenas as Horace's friend with that of Tivoli: forth
very disputable name of Maecenas's Villa in that place may'
well be discarded ⁸. The want of direct evidence for it and
still more its incompatibility with the total silence of Ho-
race, justify to my mind the rejection of such an idea with-

- out scruple and without the formality of an argument.

But for Augustus an unquestionable title may be set up,
not only as an admirer of the spot, but as an occasional
resident there, most probably, however, in the later years of
his life. Tivoli‚ it is well known, was sacred to Hercules.
Now amongst the favourite retirements of that Emperor,
Suetonius, C. 72. reckons the proxima urbi oppida, Lanu-
vium, Praeneste, Tibur .· in the last mentioned of these
towns, in porticibus Herculis templi persaepe jus dixit.
Behold then the very scene, to which Maecenas's attention
was called, when Horace thought of appealing to the case
of a retired veteran most like his own.

1 Ε. 1. 2—6. Spectatum satis, et donatum jam rude quaeris‚
Maeoenas, iterum antiquo me includere ludo.
Non eadem est aetas, non mens. Vejanius armis
Herculis ad postem fixis, latet abditus cyro,
N e populum extrema⁴ toties exoret arena.

When Horace himself at Tivoli wrote thus, he had Ve-
janius then actually in retirement there before his eye.

,And now it is high time to bring these extended remarks
to the promised conclusion, or at least to show good cause
for protraction if necessary.

the earlier part of Horace's life, with the years assigned by
