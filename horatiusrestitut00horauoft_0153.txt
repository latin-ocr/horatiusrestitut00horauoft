to render them irretrievably obscure. Of this truth, as
Gesner in his Proefatio remarkS, we have a curious example
inhumare Commentary on the Satires of Boileau; which,
though drawn up in the ‘life'time of that writer, required the
tid of the Satirist himself for the completion of the task.

Whatever now exists for illustration of Horace from
sources of that traditional kind, may be found in the Indices
Nominum like that of Zeunius, or in the Onomastieon of
the younger Ernesti. An article from the German of
Buttmann, on the Historia-al References and Allusions in
Horace, is given in the Philolog-tcal Museum, No. 111. pp.
439-484 ;⁴ to which the reader may be referred for a great
deal of curious and acute disquisition. The Greek names
Lalage, Glycera, &c.,occurringin Horace's Odes, he regards
as on the whole fictitious‚ p, 446; and cuts off all necessity
to trace the story of each person, beyond what each Ode sepa-
rately contains for elucidating itself.

For such interpretation as the knowledge of persons ad-
dtessed or of political events alluded to must supply,
Buttmann's ingenious pages, though interesting whenever
consultui, yet to my mind, on manyflpoints‚ are far from
carrying conviction: for instance, where, as at page 483, in
regar-d to Sextus Pompeius and his party, he builds so much
on hypothetical history, purely so ; and particularly where he
represents Horace “in his 27th or 28th year,'' as having
“ not yet formed any tie with the new rulers of the State.''
- As bearing on the main purpose of a work like the
present, it is clear, that after the attention paid-to Maecenas
and Augustus, the principal persons in our drama, few of
the many other Pers-ome H oratianae can require any long or
particular notice, Of those nameS, indeed, several belong
to the history of Rome, and can have little illustration here
bnt what is derived from that souree; such as Agrippa, and
Pollio, and Sallustius Crispus, the elder Lollius, and the
young Netos: others again are of the class of Roman
