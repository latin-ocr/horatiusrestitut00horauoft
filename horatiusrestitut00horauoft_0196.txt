(172) oN THE METnEs or* nonAcE.

The latter example perhaps may be defended or excused
on the same ground with the Alcaic verse, ⁷

1 C. xxxvn. 5. Antehac nefas del promere caecubum. .

Mam xv, 1 C. 111. (1) Glyconic so called. (2) As-

clepiad as in Metre xw.
(l) Sic te diva potens Cypri

(2) Sic fratres Helenae‚ lucida sidera,

The verse (1) has its scansion thus,

—— -υυ- υῧ

without any deviation: for the line 1 C. XV. 36. as some-
times edited‚ with - υ initial,

Ignis Iliacas domos. . .

should unquestionably stand thus corrected :

Ignis Pergameas domos.

On the authority of the worse reading, however, Casimir has
occasionally erred.
4 Lyric. xvr. 47. Jussit ire Borysthenem.

In this verse also the nicety of accentuation‚ which is ne-
cessary, deserves to be remarked. And the fictitious line,

Ve16ces per agros canes,

though correct in scansion and quantity, is not, however, a ’
Latin verse, because it has not the right accentual cadence
observed in the Glyconic: it has that of a verse generically
different, the Iambic dimeter,

' Ep. vr. 16. Imiltus (ιι- flebo puer.
One real line, faulty in that very way from the pen of the
elegant Grotius, which closes his Hymn of Zacharias para-

* phrased, may show, that Dr. Herbert's remark here recorded
does not guard against an imaginary error.
