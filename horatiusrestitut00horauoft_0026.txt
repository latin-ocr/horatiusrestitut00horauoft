(2) PRELIMINARY nrssnRrArxon. r

it struck my mind very forcibly, that such an edition would
be hailed by Scholars as an era in Horatian literature.

That design, however, still hung in suspense, and might
yet have been indefinitely delayed. But in the course of last
year, (1831‚) I was led to expect the appearance of a Second
Part of the Fasti Hellenici, δια, by Mr. H. Fynes Clinton‚
brought down to the death of Augustus: and that expecta-
tion inspired me with a strong anxiety to learn what the
Master Chronologist had done, under the head of Roman
Authors, towards fixing- or correcting the calculatione of
Bentley. My satisfaction of course was very great to find,
that all the principal points which had been laid down one
hundred and twenty years ago for the foundation of that
arrangement, may now be received as determined once for
all by thc very highest authority.

ΜΓ. Clinton himself on being informed of my intention
gives me the kindest encouragement to persevere: he ap-
proves of my undertaking so useful a work as an edition
of the books of Horace, arranged in chronological order:
and he assigns as a reason for his approbation, that the
neglect of that order has produced much perplexity to the
student not of Horace only, but of many other authors of
the Augustan age.

Under all these circumstances, I now am emboldened to
proceed in the task 3 and as the design in the first instance
is submitted to the judgement ofscholars, which it candidly
invites, 1 shall at once lay before them as preliminary to all
other disquisition the following extract from Bentley's Prae-
satio. The title is copied from the formula adopted by
Gesner, who in his edition of Horace gives all this extract
except what stands as the first section of it: and the divi-
· sion here made of the whole into parts commodious forre-
ference, will on that account be readily allowed.
