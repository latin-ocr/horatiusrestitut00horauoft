In the usual arrangements of his time, Horace never
appears to have been what we call a late sitter—up for
litei-ary purposes: nor was such the general custom of the
Romans. Of Augustus, however, the contrary practice is
recorded (Sueton. in August. 78.) partly for the completion
of- hia regular journal, and partly from his dislike, as a bad
sleeper perhaps, to early rising. A coena lucubratoriam se
iu lecticulam recipiebat . . , Matutine vigilia offendebatur.

To his morning studies Horace must have paid assiduous
application„ as we see him on his couch ad quartam engaged
in the'bucubratio matutina ,· and again when appealing to
his own habits in the cultivation of self-knowledge, towards
the conclusion of that admirable Satire‚

1 S· ιν. 133, 4. -——- neque enim, eum lectulus aut me
Porticus excepit, desum mihi.

Elsewhere too, at a much later period of life, he playfully
tells of himself,

‘2 Ε. 1. ΙΙΙ-113. Ipse ego qui nullos me affirmo scribere versus,
Iuvenior Parthis mendacior3 et prius orto
Sole viyil, calamum et ohartas et scrinia posco.

Audin the hortatory address to his young friend Lollius,
when he solemnly recommends the tasl( of moral reflection;
the morning honr, as a matter of course, is mentioned for
that purpose.

1 E. n. 32—37. Ut jugulent hominem, surgunt de nocte latrones;
- Ut teipsum serves, non expergisceris Ρ Atqui
Si noles sanus, curres hydropicus ι et ni
Posces ante diem librum cum lumine, si non
Intendea animum studiis et rebus honestis ς
Invidia vel amore vigil torquebere.
