but allowed to have that pronunciation‚ consilyum and prin-
cipyum, each in three syllables.

v And here it may not be impertinent to remark, that in the
hexmeoers of virgil the genitives, servitii, auxilii, δια,
though commodious to the verse, never appear; while
Horace uses only the old forms, consili and imperi, 3 C. lv,
65. 4 C. xv, 14. On the transition from the single i to

3. Let us now proceed to the subject of structure, in
some of its more important points.

Th'e place of the caesura is accurately obsewed, except in
the· following extraordinary cases,

1 C. xxxvn. 14. Mentemque lympha Ι tam Mare6ti00 .. .

4 C. ΧΠ, 17. δρωῐὲηᾱαε in cert Ι {mine Martio . . .

the latter of which from the distribution of the accents is
far less faulty than the former.

Of the three instances which follow, the caesura may per-
haps be saved by the emphatic preposition of the compound
verb in the second, but hardly so in the other two, although
relieved perhaps by the elision.

1 C. xvr. 21. Hostile aratrum eaeercitus insolens . . .
1 C. xxxvu. 5. Antehac nefas del promere Caecubum . . .

2 C. xvn. 21. Utrumque nostrum incredibili modo . . .

Not one of the three peculiarities is repeated in the latter
books.

4. The consideration of accentual cadem-e here returns

upon us. That cadence usually requires the leading accent
to fall on the fourth syllable, as,

1 C. 1x. 5, 6, Dissolve frigus . . Large reponens . . .

v or in entire words like the following, as,

3 C. 1. 25, 6. Βοείᾰεπέιηιοιῃ . . . Tumultuosum . . .
