(30) PRELIMINARY DISSERTA'I·10N.

Tivoli; and thus we distinguish, very often with little.
difficulty, what the great city allowed him to write from'

what the vacuum Tibur suggested or inspired.
Look at the light and elegant Ode to Phyllis. 4 C. xl.

vv. 2, 3. Est in horto, Ι Phylli, nectendis apium coronis, διο.

But he had no hortus at Rome3 as the same Epistle
testifies,

vv. 41, 2. invidet usum

 

 

Lignorum et pecoris tibi calo argutus et horti: ,

therefore this Ode was not written in that city.
Horace goes on thus z

vv. 34, 5. -- condisce modos, amanda Ι Voce quos reddas.

But here is the meretrix tibicina, or a lady hardly of puter
quality: therefore it was not written in the valley.

Of course Tivoli was the scene of this gay celebration of
Maecenas's birth-day.

(2.) Let us proceed to place in the true light that
beautiful Ode with its rational piety, Caelo supinas, &a
3 C. xxnl. The Rustica Phidyle, there addressed, is
considered as having been haud dubie Villica in fundo
Horatii Sabino ,· and even the grave and cautious Gesner
says, Lepida certe Daeerii et Sanadoni suspicio, Hora-
tium astute dissimulata Epicurei persona sic voluisse
impedire, ne in villa sud nimii sumtus fierent in sacri-
ficia.

Now it certainly does appear from Cato De re rustic-d, in
sacrificia, that the Villioa in his time was bound to offer no
sacrifice without order from her master or mistress. Scito
dominum, he adds, pro tota familia rem divinam-facere ;
and Columella, who after the lapse of two centuries, has
⁴to lament the progress of refinement as deteriorating the
character of the rural domini, (Lib. ΧΠ. Praefat. pp. 551‚2.
Ed. Schneider,) inserts amongst the qualifications of a
good Villica, that she be a superstitionibus remotissima.
