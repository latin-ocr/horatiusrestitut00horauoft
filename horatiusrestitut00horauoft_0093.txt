dlow3 and the same remark may be extended *to t-he xvxth
Epode, Altera jam teritur . .. . which from similarity of
subject might be expected to stand in conjunction with the
nuh, vere it not (as we have seen in other cases) for the
sake of variety, perhaps, kept separate. ἢ

Both those Epodes, in any thing like allusion to the
luders of the great political parties, are obscure novv, from
the Poet's studied delicacy at the time: as long as any hope
remained of healing the breach, Horace was not the man to
aggravate the discord. But when matters had come to an
open rupture, in that Epode, 1. Ibis Liburnis . . . he tes-
tifles at once his personal devotedness to Maecenas, and his
'ear-nest desire to accompany his Patron to the scene of ap-
proaching conflict: and in the 1xth Epode, Quando re-
postum . . . on the first news of Caesar's victory at Actium,
Horace naturally addi-esses Maecenas in a strain of the most
delighted gratulation‚ yet even then (v. 29) not naming
Antony, though he clearly alludes to him ; while the
disgraceful pheuomenon of (Cleopatra's) gauze-curtain, in
a scene like that, is represented as moving the indignation
even of foreigners to forsake such a leader ;

Ep. ιι. 15—18. Interque signa turpe militaria
Sol aspicit conopium.
Ad hoc frementes verterunt bis mille equos
Galli canentes Caesarem.

It was about a year (Β. c. 30) after that memor-able engage-
ment, when the affair at Alexandria had left Caesar without
a rival, that Horace broke out in his final effusion of joy,
1 C. xxxvrr. Nunc est bibendum . . . ‚ connected with that
eventful epoch.

Now that we are advancing from the Epodes to the Odes,
it is lucky that Horace in his Epistle, Prisco εἰ credi-s .. .
to Maecenas, (x 1x.) de suis et Poetastrorum sui saeculi scrip-
tis, has himself afforded a delicate clue for the transition.
