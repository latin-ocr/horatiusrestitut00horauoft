, Now all this could never be true of Lucilius, if he had been

then, as the calculation would make him, barely in his

nineteenth year.
Mr. H. F. Clinton is led by these and other considerations

to “ assume that the birth of Lucilius was a few years earlier,
and his death a few years later, than the date of Hierony-
mus.” Additions and Corrections to Vol. 111. given in
Vol. 1. pp. 426, 7.

4. Still, however, supposing these points in bioqraphy to
be cleared up, as we trust they are, yet on the other hand
if Bentley's Chronology can be any where shown to be in-
compatible with well ascertained facts of history, there can
be nothing left for us but to surrender at. discretion.

First of all, however, a very important caveat may well
claim to be admitted here.

Historical language is precise, direct and plain, free from
all question or ambiguity. The allusive language of Poetry,
especially where the Poet's eye is at all frenzied with pride
and patriotism, beholds the future in the present and trans-
mutes symptoms into successes.

On this hint let me have the indulgence to speak. In
the year Β. c. 20, and not before, F.H.p. 240. (1 E. xv111.
55. Sub duce, qui templis Parthorum signa refigit Ι Nunc,
ἃς.) the standai-ds of Crassus were actually restored by the
Parthians ; that is the declaration of history: but as early as
B. c. 34, and long before any thing was effected about the
standards, the language of Horace might lead one to sup-—
pose that satisfaction was even then on> the point of being
obtained. 2 S. v, 62. Tempore quo juvenis Parthis hor-
rendus. . . . and in the Ode (2 c. 1x.) Non semper imbres
. . . . more distinctly still.
