ΟΝ AUGUSTUS CAESAR AND THE SECOND
ODE‚ JAM SATIS TERRJS.

 

Tun notion of this well-known poem having been written
on account of the prodigies which followed the assassination

but for a moment recollected, that Horace himself was at
Athens in that year (B. c. 44.) and in the following years
was serving under Brutus, as tribunus militum. The argu-

who grounds it on facts recorded by Dio, seems to affor-d as
complete a satisfaction perhaps, as such a question in this
age can well admit.

That historiari informs us, (L. Lm. 16, 20.) that in the
night of that day, the Ides of January, B. c. 27, on which

tremendous inundation. Whatever prognostic of Augus-
tus's future greatness might, if Dio reports it aright, be
formed by soothsayers, Horace appears to have been led
into a very different train of sombre reflection. He construes
that awful visitation into a divine call for new measures to
expiate the accumulated guilt of so continued a civil war.
