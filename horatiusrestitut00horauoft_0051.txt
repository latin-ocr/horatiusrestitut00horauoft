we are clearly indebted for Horace's assuming a poetical
‘character entirely neW, in the translation to the Romame
fidicen lyrae (4 C. 111. 23.) from the writer of Satires and
Epodes only. In one word, then, on his own express
authority, on that spot, and at that time, his lyric writings

Two out of the eight passageS‚ here adduced, on which I

''riv-oli, may in that view justify a more particular notice.

His invitation (No. 111.) to Septimius has been well illus-
trated by the late Mr. George Hardinge. (Nichols. Lite-
rary History. u. s. p. 732.)

“ Horace begins by telling him that he knows his friend
would accompany him to the remotest and wildest part of
the world :

Septimi, Gades aditure mecum, et

Cantabrum indoctum juga ferre nostra, et

Bai-baras Syrtes, ubi Maura semper
AEstuat unda.

‘⁶ Of course he should be equally desirous to accompany
his friend: but he means to decline it, and he is to give the
reason for it, which is, that he wishes for no Tarentum,
unless DRIVEN from Tuum. The Ode in any other sensc
would be unintelligible, and the wish for Tibur absurd,
especially with a reference to his old aye, which had not
'then arrived‚” sne. διὸ.

That Alcaic Stanza (No. Iv.) forms quite a loeus clas-
'sit-us in the personal history of Horace.
