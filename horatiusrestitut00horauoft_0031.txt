ΒΥ Dacier in great contempt‚) that work has been quoted
with much deference ΒΥ later editors3 and more or less
formed on the basis of Masson's Vita οι· of the chronologia
per Consules of Dacier have been those compilations under
the title of Q. Horatii Fla-cci Vita per annos digesta, which
have even recently appeared.

Amongst the very latest of those who have merely gone
in the old path so long trod before them, let not Mitscher-
lich, the German editor of the Odes, be overlooked. He
wholly rejects the scheme of Bentley, and in his Preface,
p. xxi. after dar-ing to pronounce...infirma omnino Bentleii
temporum ratio...he brings forward an objection founded
on an allusion to the Cantabri. 3 C. viii. 21. Whoever
will turn to the Fasti of Mr. Clinton, 13. c. 23. p. 237, may
see how the objection is answered and the credit of Bentley
maintained by a touch of the pen from that unrivalled
chronologist.

1 embrace the occasion here offered, to acknowledge the
great faithfulness and talent so conspicuous in the recent
biography of Bentley; and on the general question before
us, 1 adopt with much gratification the judgment (perfectly
coincident with my own) which the biographer so strongly
and comprehensively delivers.

“ Bentley's scheme of the Tempora Horatiana is con-
demned by Mitscherlich, the Leipsic editor: but he is a
person of little or no authority ; and in this case he appeals
to the life of Horace, by J ani, an abridgement of Masson's‚
one of those productioris to correct the errors of which,
Bentley's theory was coinposed.”—Dr. Monk's Life of
Bentley, p. 245, 8vo.

But whatever excuse Ι may thus plead for leaving the
now obsoleto merits of Messrs. Faber, Dacier and Masson
under “the balance and the rod” in Bentley's hands;
