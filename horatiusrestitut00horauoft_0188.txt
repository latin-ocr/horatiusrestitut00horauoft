(164) Α on 'rim nerlu-:s OF nonant.

The words of the Romans then were accented by an 'in'-
variable rule (and do we not now follow a similar rule in-
reading Latin ?) namely, that if the penult be long, it shall
be accented, as amabarm if it be short, the antepenult
shall be accented, whether long or short, as amaveram,
potaeram.

All monosyllables were accented; and in these pages, if
not' ‘so marked, may be always so reekoned. Only, enclitics
like que, ve, ne, must be taken as forming part of the pre-‘ ·
ceding word. Thus,

Ep. 11. 45. claudensque textis. . . .

Now· for the application. The Iambic trimeter in its
legitimate construction, whatever other accent it has, takes
a leading one on the sixth place: or if not so, then it
usually requires to be accented on the fourth and the eighth.

Thus,

Ep. 1. 3. Paratus omne Cae'saris periculum. .

——- 7. Utrumne jfissi persequemur otium.
The leading accent on the sixth, though generally with
penthemimeral caesura, and at the beginning of a word as ¹
in Cae'saris above, may yet be otherwise circumstanced, as,

Ep. 1. 15. Roges, tuum labore quid juvem meo.

n
a d Ep. 11. 19. Ut gaudet insitiva decerpens pyra.

Nay, more:
Ep. 1. 19. Ut assidens implfimibus pullis avis,

is an Iambic verse, because the sixth is aceentedz- whereas
’ Ut assidens pallis avis deplumibus,
though exactly' the same as to quantities, would not be a ¹
verse, on account of the wrong position of the accentS.
A similar remark may be made on

Ep. x1. 15. Quod si meis inae'stuat praecordiis,
as having neither caesura; and yet it is an Iambic verse

from the correctness of its leading accent.
In long words constituted like inverecundus, if not in
