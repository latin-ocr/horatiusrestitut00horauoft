(116) ΑΡΡΕΝΜΧ 111.

From the view taken of Maecenas on this broad scale, let us
turn to that Ode of dedication, by which more than by any
other tribute to his name he has hitherto been so well known
to the admirers of Horace.

The Ode (1 C. 1. Mcecenas atavis..) has very much
laboured under one misinterpretation and one false lection
which may deserve the regard of the critical reader.

Ι. In the text of this edition, the lines which follow..
evehit ad Deos, with a full stop after those words, stand

thus punctuated.

vv. 7—-14. Hunc si mobilium turba Quiritium

Certat tergeminis tollere honoribus z
Illum, si proprio condidit horreo
Quidquid de Libycis verritur areis ς
Gaudentem patrio findere sarculo
Agros, Attalicis conditionibus
Nunquam dimoveas, ut trabe Cypria
Myrtoum pavidus nauta secet mare.

If the true sense, as received by many editors, be deter-
mined by that punctuation, it may be asked: how came the
passage ever to be interpreted otherwise ? Ι feel no scruple
then in imputing to two distinct causes all the error into
which any of the commentators have» been 'misled : partly,
to their not being aware that Gaudentem. . .is justly em-
ployed to designate a separate character, Him who deliyhts
(like Desiderantem quod satis est. ‚3 C. 1. 25, Him who
bounds lais desire by a competency 3 Fulqentem imperio. .
3 C. xvi. 31. Hem who has the splendid government‚ δια,
&c.)‚ and yet more, to the disregard of a great peculiarity
frequent enough in the best Greek and Latin authors;
namely, that after two or more specific subjects of thought
⁴ are expressed‚ they do not seek, as modern nicety requires,
some such mode of concluding the sentence, as may belong
in common to all the notions that precede, but boldly and
almost carelessly conclude it with what is strictly proper
to that subJect only which comes immediately last.
