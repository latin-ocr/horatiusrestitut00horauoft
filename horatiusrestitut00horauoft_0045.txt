LOCALITIES. - (21)

not long after, he was possessed of a nus and villula in the
Sabine valley : and chan-med with the scenery of Tibur,
which on his way from Rome into the Sabine country he
osten halted to admire, he finally became master of a cottaqe
with a qarden to it in the precincts of Tibur or as it is now
called T ivoli. ’

It was on this latter spot, if 1 may be allowed to antici-
pate, that he dedicated the pine-tree to Diana, (3 C. XXII.
Montium custos. ..) in an ode remarkable also for its conti-
guity in position to that beautiful ode to Phidyle, Coelo su-
pina-3 . . . which will be found to bear such decisive evidence
to the ⁰very same locality. May we not also with some
probability suppose, that of the two passages in which a
fondness for building is imputed to Horace, the first, 2 S.
111, 308. AEdificas, &c., must be referred to the new erection
οι· repairs required for his comfort in the Sabine valley;
while the Second, 1 E. 1,100. Diruit, (edificat, δια, written
at a latter period, naturally carries our thoughts to improve-
ments at Tivoli, in which he might then be engaged.

And here at setting out, let me avow that I feel no scruple
in imputing'the Frns’r great source of confusion and error
to that unluck'y expression in the Life attributed to Sueto-
nius. “Vixit plurimum in secessu nnius sui Sabini aut Ti-
burtini : domusque ejus ostenditur circa Tiburni luculum.''
And the phrase itself‚ Sabim· aut Tiburtini, had its origin,
there can be no doubt, in the Iambic Scazons of Catullus
Ad Fundam. XL.

Ο Funde noster, seu Sabine, seu Tiburs,

Nam te esse Tiburtem autumant, quibus nonest
- Cordi Catullum laedere ς at quibus oordi est,

Quovis Sabinum pignore esse contendunt.

The author, whoever he was, of that Life, apparently quite
ignorant of the Sabine valley‚ never seems to have sup—
posed, that Horace had any rural residence except at Tivoli,
