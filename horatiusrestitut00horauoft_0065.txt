mvn Asu CHARACTER. (41)

The impression on his mind was altogether deep and
awful. Accordingly, in that affectionate address to his pa-
tron, Cur me querelis, ὅτε. (2 C. xvn), with Maecenas's
recovery from illness and the loud joy on his reappearance
in public,

 

cum populus frequens
Laetum theatris ter crepuit sonum.

is associated his own happy rescue as deserving of similar
remark, Δ

Me truncus illapsus cerebro
Sustulerat, nisi Faunus ictum
Dextra levasset, Mercurialium
' Custos virorum.

And elswhere in connection with his escape from the perils
of battle and of shipwreck, when addressing the Muses, he
imputes that preservation also to the same kindly influence.

3 C. 1v. 25, 27. Vestris amicum fontibus et choris . . . .
Devota non extinxit arbor.

Finally, in an ode of invitation to Maecenas, (worthy to be
classed with those other two, 1 C. xx. Vile potabis, δια,
and 3 C. xxm. Tyrrhena reglum, &c.,) we find the Poet‚
in pursuance of a solemn vow to Bacchus, (2 E. 11. 78. Rite
cliens Bacchi somno gaudentis et umbra.,) celebrating on the
Calends of March the anniversary of his deliverance.

It may be a more difficult attempt to’assign the probable
year, in which the elder Horace, dissatisfied with the country
school of Flavius, determined to remove with his son to
Rome, for the benefit of the highest instruction which could
there be obtained. That son, on the retrospect of this in-
teresting period, when he asserts his own exemption as well
from low profligacy as from the sordes of avarice; gives
this account of whatever was innocent or amiable in the
whole of his character.
