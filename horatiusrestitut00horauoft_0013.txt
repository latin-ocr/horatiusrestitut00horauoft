⁵ RS. An earnest anxiety to learn whatever yet may bc
accurately known about the Fons Bandusinus,maintained to
be the old genuine and only fountain of that name, near
⁵ to Venusia (or Venosa), induced me to consult Dr. George
Errington, Pro-Rector of the English college at Rome.
Accordingly 1 requested from him the advantage of any re-
search which his command of the libraries there might give,
into ‘the subject proposed3 he was particularly desired to
’ examine every document which he could find, bearing on the
question in the Abbe Chaupy's Decouverte de la Maison de
Campaqne d'Horace, Vol. 111. pp. 364. 538, ὅτε.

In a long, curious, entertaining Letter lately received, my
learned and accomplished correspondent assures me, that
while the extract itself from the Bull of Pascal the 11d (about
which I inquired) is indeed literally correct, he considers its
application, however, as very suspicion& from the manner
in which Chaupy “ sees a little, presumes a great deal, and
so jumps to the conclusion.'' Ἴ
⁶ The passage quoted by Chaupy and more fully given by

’ Mr. Hobhouse (vide the close of the Dissertation for parti-
culars) contains, to be sure, various words—de Castello
Bandusii-in Bandusino fonte apud Venusiam, &c., which
seem full of excellent promise: but when rigidly examined,
those words leave nothing essential, beyond the simple fact,
that in the year A.D. 1103, “ at or near Venosa there was a

· Church called in Fonte Bandusino, for what cause so called

cannot now be ascertained.''

The fountain itself‚ somewhere in that neighbourhood be-
yond a doubt, existed apparently in Horace's day. But
while the precise spot of the Poet’s birth, on the banks of the
Aufidus, and therefore if geography may be trusted, noc im-
mediately near to Venusia, has but little chance now of
ever being exactly determined, the original Fons Bandusinus
must without asigh be resignedto its fate3 perhaps that of an

¹ extinct fountain in a country more or less subject to volcanic
