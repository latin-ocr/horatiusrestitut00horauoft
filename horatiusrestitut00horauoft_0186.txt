authority, to illustrate, in some of the most striking. i'n—
stances, the connection existing betwixt the places of accent
in Horatian metro, and the legitimate structure of the verse.
For a complete and satisfactory view of the subject in all
its bearings, the reader must be referred to the pages of the
original article.

Before proceeding to the task itself deMetris Horatianis,
it may be prudent if not necessary to define the end pro-
posed in that labour. In all the metres I-shall hope to
make the structure of the verse as well as the scansion un-
derstood3 while in the most important of them, especially
those much in use for exercises of imitative composition, Ι
shall indulge greater latitude of practical detail. Agreeably
to that view and purpose, the nineteen denominations in Ho-
race will be treated of thus. T hose in the Epodes, (num-
bered 1.*to vn.,) which in the just order of publication now
stand first, may in general be dispatched with less of ceren ⁴
monious regard; and those in the Odes, (VIII. to xn.‚)
hardly lyrical measures, either from difficult construction
abandoned after one or two experiments, oi· from whatever
cause not -much favoured by Horace, will occupy a briefer
notice, but still with sufficient correctness. Thus, a larger
consideration may be fairly granted to verses of that spe-
cies (xm. to xv1i.) which has its character from the Chori-
ambus interposed: and a still more extensive space will
thus be allowed to the two principal metres (xvnr. and
iux.) in the Sapphic and the Alcaic stanza. ⁴
