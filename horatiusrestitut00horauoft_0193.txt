Mle-run· 1x. 4· C. vu. (1) Dactylic hexameter, as be-
fone, with (2) the latter half of a Dactylic pentameter.

’ (2) Arbon-{busque oomae.

Ι Mna-nn x. 1 C. v111. (1) one Choriambus (-υν-) initial
followed by Bacchius (υ- -) οι· Amphibraeh (υ-ν), with
(2) Sapphicus major, οι· the long Sapphic.

(1) Lydia, dic per omnes
(2) Te deos oro Ι sybarin Ι cur properes amando.

 

The verse (1) has its scansion thus,

υυυυυ -c,

Q and for structure always has a Dactylic word or a Dactylic
combination to begin with, so as to exclude the accent

on the thitd syllable ε
Saepe {timor Ι fugavit,

accordingly, would be illegitimate.

The verse (2) has for its scansion the Epitritus secundus
(-ν--) with two choriambi and a trisyllabic ending like (1).

-υ--- -υυ- —uu—

and for structure it has two regular caesuras as in the quoted
line.

The following construction, it is evident, would violate
the accentual cadence of the verse,

'l'e deos oramus Ι I‘tyn cur properes amando . .

as well as the law of the caesura.
