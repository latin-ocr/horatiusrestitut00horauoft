The pertrait of Agricola, known to every scholar, as drawn
at full length by the affectionate pencil of his son-in-laW,
'may conclude the catalogue. The partial admiration, how-
ever, of Tacitus for that great and good man, has tempted
the biographer into an apparent severity of reflection on
persons not endowed with felicity of temperament like his.

· And yet Agricola, we read, even if he died by a natural
‚ death, was hardly permitted to end his days in peace. Nor
could Tacitus, when afterwards on the high road of his-
torical duty, deny the stamp of his deepest praise to Paetus
Thrasea and Barea Soranus, and to other noble spirits,
whose examples of fortitude and honesty‚ in the worst of
times, demonstrate that Cassius himself (Annal. 1v. 343)
was not* truly called the ultimus Romanorum.

fachion ·in other respects, but pettily ostentatious of his ⁷
wealthss' has been already noticed (App.v 111. p. 114) in proof
ofMaecenas's sometimes going out to an early, that is, to a
fashionable dinner. The name of the entertainer has
afforded scope for the acuteness and erudition of Buttmann
(u. ε. p. 472.) in pursuing the conjecture of Lambinus,
that, to preserve some semblance of delicacy, Horace under
that grotesque name really intended to denote SALvmmNth
Rufa-3, a person historically known from many writers who
have mentioned him.
