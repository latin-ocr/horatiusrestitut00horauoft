‘⁶ Diis patriis Italoque coel0‚'' to the great deligh‘t of *his
friend Horace. That Ode, O saepe meeum, which aster so
many years of long separation records the joyful honr of
their meeting again, is imbued with all the spirit of the
kind-hearted man and the convivial bard. As an authentic
record also (in part) of Horace's own history, it is invaluahle;
ranking indeed with those principa] sources of authentic in-
telligence‚ Nunc ad me redeo . . ,1 S. v1. 45—131. and Ro-

mae nutriri. . .2 Ε. 11. 41—52.

With a verse in that Epistle it may be worth the while
to compare two lines of the Ode, as no bad example of Ho-
race tracked in his own snOW.

vv. 15, 163. Te rursus in bellum resorbens
Unda fretis tulit oestuosis.

v. 47. Civilisque rudem belli tulit oestus in arma, &c-

The bad conscience or the diseased mind, the Atra
'Cura, of our Poet may be similarly traced‚ and not without
interest, through the different stages of its progress. 2 S.
v11. 114, 5.—-2 C. xv1. 21, 2.-3 C. 1. 39, 40.-4 C. x1.
35, 6. That splendid imagination reached its acme in the
”third of those passages.

vv. 37040. 1 Sed Timor et Minae
Scandunt eodem, quo dominus : neque

 

Deoedit aerata triremi, et {f
Post equitem sedet atra Cura. ³

Though in less interesting parallels, the Scholar with Ho-
race's writin'gs in true suecession placed before him, may de-
rive some amusement from tracing in different stages the re-
markable similitude of sentiment: the following instances
*may deserve attention.

2 C. xm. l. ι Otium Divos rogat in patente
