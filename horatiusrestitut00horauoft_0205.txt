1. In the first and second lines, through the first and
second books, a marked preference of the Spondaic begin-
ing to the Iambic is quite obvious: this becomes more
striking still through the third book: and -the fourth book

has not one instance, even with a polysyllabic word as in

the third, much less with a dissyllabic word initial, of an
Iambus thus placed:

1 c.‚xxx1. 17ss Frui Ι paratis, et valido mihi . . .

3 C. 1. 2. Favete Ι linguis .- carmina non prius . . .

 

— 26. Tumultuosum . . .

In addition to the fact already adduced‚ P. D. p. 13, of
the more severe model of structure in the third line intro-
duced by Horace into the latter books of his Odes, we haye
here shown that in other points also a fine sensibility of ear
led him to yet nicer improvements as congenial to the Latin
tongue3 which in imitative composition must now be re-
garded, if any respect is due to the authority of Horace.

2. The following cases of elision may deserve a brief
notice.

Of elisions after the caesura like the follow-ing,

1 C. xxxxv. 13. Mutare, et insignem Ι attenuat Deus.
3 C. 1. 5. Regum timendorum 1 in proprios greges.
there are not quite twenty in all.
