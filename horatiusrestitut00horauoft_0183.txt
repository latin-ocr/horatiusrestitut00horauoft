'THE METRES

'OF

HORACE.

 

In presenting to Scholars a new Treatise on the Metres of
Horace, Ι cannot but anticipate a candid reception for
what is so proposed. Whatever has been hitherto done
under that title, has seldom exceeded a meagre account ί and
that not in all points accurate) of -the scansion merely, with
little or no regard to the verse in its structure. The very
latest tract, bearing date 1803‚—that which Doering has
given as a communication from hi's friend Sparr, deserves
generally the compliment paid by him of being very skil-
fully and correctly executed. Yet even that, though seldom
(ainted with absolute error, is greatly deficient in some essen-
tial points, as to Horace's earlier and later modes of con-
structing the same verse. This remark will be strikingly
apparent in our account of the Alcaic Stanza3 occasionally
it will be verified in others also.

If the question be asked on what grounds the present
treatise may be entitled to higher consideration as more
nearly embracing every desideratum which belongs to the
subject3 let it be said once for all, that from various sources
of critical observation, in which my own professional study

for many years had its due share, the work now publishcd
has been very diligently composed.
