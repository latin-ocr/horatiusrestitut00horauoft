(66) ΡηΕιῐΜιΝΑιιΥ DISSERTATION.

and in that (xvth.) to Numonius Vala, Quae sit hyeme Veliae,
quod coelum, Vala, Salerni, &a when he thought of going
to the cold-baths of the one place or the other, after he has
stated (vv. 2, 3.) Antonius Musa's judgment on his case,
Mihi Baias supervacuas · . . Horace proceeds to tell his
friend, that he will have to ride his horse past the hitherto

* In the golden treatise De Senectute (ἓ x1v.) old Cato

describes in qeneral his convivial enjoyments: Me vero et '
