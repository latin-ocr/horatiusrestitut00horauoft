(16) PRELIMINARY Dlssnn'rArioN.

 

neque em'm concludere versum
Dixeris esse satie .· neque, si quis scribat, uti nos,
Sermmzi propiora, putea hunc ease poetam.

From this passage, Hardouin very ingeniously and justly
concludes, Horatium se nullas odas scripsisse profiteri:
nothing in itself more true AT THAT TIME. ⁴But the
good Father too hastily assumed, that the odes if written
by Horace at all, had been written as their collocation to
him indicated, at some period prior to that of the Satires.
H ardeam would have been disarmed of at least one argu-
ment, perhaps in his opinion a very strong one; if he
had ever viewed the books of Horace in the order of their
original publication.

(2.) If there be any truth in Bentley s calculations, the
2d book of these Satires was collectively published not later
than the year Β. c. 32. If there be any saith in the Fasti
Hellenici, the restoration of the Roman Eagles from
Parthia did not take place earlier than the year Β. c. 20.

Horace (2 S. 1. 10—15) when thus urged by his learned
friend Trebatius,

Aut si tantus amor scribendi te rapit, aude
Caesaris invicti res dicere, mu ta laborum
Praemia laturus.

declines the task with much elegance and address‚ on the
ground of inability to describe the soenes of heroic warfare.

 

cupidum, pater optime, vires
‚Deficiunt ; neque enim quivis horrentia pilis
Agmina, nec fracta pereuntes cuspide Gallos,

-Aut labentis equo describat vulnera Parthi.

' The-Parthians and Gauls‚ from having been the principal
objects of dread to the Roman armies, are the nations
. selected to furnish, each of them, a very tremendous image
of battle3 with a tacit reference perhaps to the exploits of
Marius at a distant period and of Ventidius on a later
occasion, Β. c. 39.
