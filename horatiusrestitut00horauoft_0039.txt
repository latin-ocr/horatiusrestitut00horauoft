’ Let us now procecd to exemplify by a few striking in-
stances what absurdity is involved in the common order of
the books of Horace being taken for the true one, and what
immediate congruity on the other hand arises from observing
the arrangement of Bentley.

(l.) Horace in the 1vth Satire of his lst book, νν. 39-
55. shows a great anxiety to disclaim all pretence to the
higher character of a poet z and well he might, without any
mock modesty‚ disavow it. At that early period of his life
and wrifings, he had nothing to ground the claim upon, ex-
cept tbe limited publication of a few satires, and the farther
promise of talent in that particular vein.

But hear what M. Dacier says, as reported by Dr.

Francis.

“ 54. Eryo Ι Non sacis est puris versum perscribere verbis.

M. Dacier thinks, that Horace would not have been so
modest with regard to his Satires, and so fearful of prosti-
tuting the name of poet, if he had not secured his own right
to it by his Odes.”

Hear next M. Sanadon. (Vol. 11. p. 169.)

“39. Primum eyo me illorum, dederim quibus esse poetis,
Emer-pam numero.

Horace s'etoit deja *assure par ses odes le nom de Poste,
ainsi il ne risque rien ὲ se degrader pour ses satires.
Sa modestie n'en est que plus grande, et cette vertu ne
sauroit etre petite dans un poete, pourvfi qu'elle soit bien
sincere.'' No exposure can make blunders like these more
ridiculous: they cannot be aggravated by any comment.
Pei-e Ilm-doum, on the contrary, (Vid. KLo'rzn Lectiones
venusinae, pp. 15, 39, 40. 1770,) who amongst many
paradoxes maintained this, Horatii Poetae nihil superesse
genuinum, praeter Epistolas et Sermones, draws a very
different conclusion out of the verses before us.
