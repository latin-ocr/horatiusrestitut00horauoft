Assuming this origin of the Satire to be correct, we may
accept as literally true, Horace's own account of his begin-

In all the books of Horace, indeed, those of Satires, of
Epodes, of OdeS, and of Epistles, as the constituent parts
now stand arranged in each, I am strongly of opinion, that
after a due allowance for much caprice and casualty perhaps,
there may still be discovered great ingenuity shown by
Horace himself in the close succession by which some pieces
are brought together, and not less of skill, judgmeut, and
delieacy in the intentional disjunction of others.

The peculiar consideration here suggested from'internal
evidence, will support the whole hypothesis of Bentley by a
train of argument not perhaps suspected before. To exem-
plify the nature of that reasoning, let a few clear instances
suffice for the present.

Thus the similarity of attachment which Horace bore to
both his friends, Septimius and Pompeius, may fairly ac-
count for the neighbourly collocation which those two beau-
tiful Odes (2 C. v1, v11.) now occupy.

And thus the general similitude of subject in the two
Epistles, xvxi. to Scaeva, and xv111. to Lollius, (younger
brother to him addressed, Maxime Lolli, l E. 11. 1‚) though
addressed to two characters totally dissimilar, doubtless led
to their juxtaposition when published.

- Strangely enough, with all the obvious difference between
the characters, even Gesner (ad 1 E. xv111. 1.) is inclined ’
to think that the two persons might be identically the same,
and that of the two Epistles as they now stand, the latter
