Mr. Giffmd, indeed, in his preface to Persius, considers
the lives under the name of Suetonius as compilations from
different Scholia of unequal value. But allowing Suetonius
himself to have been the author, yet even he lived and wrote
a full century after the death of Horace. And to a spot in

neighbourhood. When therefore the Avvocato D. Domenico
