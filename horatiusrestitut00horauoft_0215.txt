vise done in Alcaic verse since the revival of Letters, not a
single monosyllabic verb or noun, occupying the sixth sylla-
ble, ever found admission into the 317 stanzas of Horace.
12. The third verse may not end with a dissyllabic word
followed by a monosyllable, unless it be an enclitic, as

 

3 C. xxtx. 55. probamque

Pauperiem sine dote quaero.

One form of exception only occurs, it was never repeated:

2 C. x11. 19. Depfme stib lauru mea, Ι neo
Parce cadis tibi destinatis.

a line without a parallel, as having an accent on the seventh
syllable, and not having it, like all others, on the eighth.

13. Of those favour-ite or allowed forms of the third verse -
which constitute that keystone as it were of the Alcaic
stanza, the following brief enumeration may serve.

The forms most predominant, then, in all the books, with
their structure und accentual cademe, are exemplified in this
verse,

A. ἐν ι ---Ι 0--
1 G. ιι. 7. Depr6me Ι quadrimum Ι Sabine. .

of which the number amounts nearly to 150 out of the whole
317. But under that scheme, let it be understood, we class
all the lines which are thus similarly constructed in their
component words; except as far as the monosyllabic words
having an accent, though not expressed, constitute the
difference.

l C. lx. 19. Ιιειιέεᾳυθ Ι sub n6ctem1 susurri. .
