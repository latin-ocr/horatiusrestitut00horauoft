The topic here started is full of matter for curious and
interesting investigation ε whether on the one hand we
suppose that several ingenious arm, being already introduced
into Rome in the persons of slaves, would only very slowly be
admitted as objects of liberal pursuit 3 or reflect, on the other
hand, that the system of clientela, however well it might work
in an earlier stage of the commonwealth, at a later period
could only tend to keep the clientes too proud to gain what
we should call an honest and reputable livelihood, so long
as they were able barely to live on the allowance made by
the patroni. Hence the pride of caste was maintained, but
at the eost of all manly independence: and in the client
whom Juvenal describes thus subsisting as the poor gentle-
man of his day, we see the miserable wreck of Roman
freedom, and of all the higher virtues by which it was once

adorned.

Sat. 1. 117-120. Sed cum summus honor finito computet anno,
Sportula quid referat, quantum rationibus addat,
Quidfaoient comites, quibus lanc toya, calceus hmo est,
Ec panis fumusque domi. ‘2

Among the Libertini upon record it might be difficule
to point out any one person entitled to a higher degree of
respect than Horace the elder. And in the year Β. c. 66,
(when the Mithridatio war was committed to Pompey by the
Manilian law,) we may probably enough fix that worthy
man's marriage and establishment in the neighbourhood of
Venusia upon the Lar et Fundus (2 E. 11. 52), in which her
had invested the whole of his honest acquisitions.

On that estate then, not far from the town of Venusia,
apparently very near to the river Aufidus,

4 C. lx. 2. Longe sonantem natus ad Aufidum,
vito Idus Decembres. Dec. 8. Β. c. 65, the great Roman
Poet‚ Quintus Horatius Flaccus, was born; who more than
once in his writings, while he distinctly marks the place of
his birth, records it as inauspicious for any chance of poetic
same to the native of a spot so rude and obscure.
