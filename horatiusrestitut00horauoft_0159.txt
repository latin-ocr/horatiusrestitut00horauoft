imputed to him elsewhere by Seneca, even with the words
solutis ’ tunicis, Ep. xx. 115. and re-echoed by Juvenal,
must have been realimd, (postquam illum enervasset felici-
teia), in the acquired foibles of his later years only.

In ‘this view of the whole matter, we· instantly discover
<what the plausible error was that misled the commentator
Acron, catching up the general hint from Seneca and J uve-
nal, &c.‚ and utterly disregarding the chronological series of
things; without attending to ι which even the cleverest
scholar-s, it has been shown, have fallen into very strange
hallucinations. .

The elder Scaliger, in his Poetice, 1607, p. 344, shall
here be quoted, in farther proof of the gross mistakes com-
mitted by the most eminent critics, from ignorance or ne—
glect of chronology.

Ingratus Horatius, atque animo barbaro atque servili, qui

tunicarum demissione offenderetur.

· At the time when the first book of Satires was published,
that ayer Sabinus, as we have already seen, had yet to be

tion by Wieland abroad, and by our own elder Colman at
home, to set the Epistola ad P1soN1-:s de Arte Poetica in
-its true light, that hardly any room is left to desiderate or
expect farther elucidation of it now,

If, however, any fal-ther proof were wanted that the family
of the Pisos did cultivate poetical talem, and with some dis-
tinction too, the following extract from Pliny's Letter to
Spurinna (v. 17.) may serve to place that fact beyond a
doubt . . . nuncio tibi fuisse me hodie in auditorio Calpurnii
