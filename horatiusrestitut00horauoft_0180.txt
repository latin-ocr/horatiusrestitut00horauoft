tentius, the tria lumina of the commentaries of that learned
age upon Horace.

My humbler office embraces only a few of the most pro·
minent deviations here admitted from the common text,
sufficient by way of specimen to show in what light 1 have
viewed the task or duty of an Editor at the present day.

Those remarkable passages, as here without scruple
edited,

1 C. 1. 29. TE doctarum hederae praemia frontium, δια,
and

3 C. xx1x. 6. Ur semper-udum Tibur, διο. s
have received an ample discussion, but not too much for
their importance, the latterjn P. D. p. 24, and the former
in App. ΠΙ. p. 119. ’

With the same frankness let me avow that the time is
come when similar decision may elsewhere be justified;
especially in regard of such texts, as, after the strong doubt
or perplexity excited by the criticism of able scholars,
cannot be satisfactorily construed unless with some slight·
change, itself of a probable nature. ’

Four cases of that sort are the following:

(l) 1 C. xxnr. 5. Nam, seu mobilibus vepris inhorruit
Ad ventum foliis ;

otherwise edited veris and vitis.
Bentley's note on the passage amounts to demonstration.

(2) 1 C. xxxvrn. 5. Simplici myrto nihil adlabores,
Sedulus στω-ιε.

with the syntax like that of
1 S. 1x. 11, 123 x..2l. Cerebriselicem

 

Seri studiorum,

and ,
1 C. xx11. 1. Integer vitae, διο.
The eommon readings, try them as you will, of eura or
cura, absolutely defy all attempts at rational interpretation.

(3) 2 C. xiv. 26, 7, 8.
