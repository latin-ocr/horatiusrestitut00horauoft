some distinct notice is unquestionably due to the subsequent'
name of Monsieur Sanado‘n, from its being so eminent in·
the criticism of Horace for right οι· for wrong.

In the year 1728, from the press of Claude Robustel, ὰ
Paris, there came forth in two handsome quarto volirme's
primdspecie a very splendid work: Les Poesies d’Horace
dispose‘es suivant l'ordre chronologique et traduites en Fran-
cois: avec des Remarques et des Dissertations critiques.
Par le R. P. Sanadon, de la Compagnie de J esus.

The object of Mr. Sanadon avowedly embraces a very
bold and radical change. He does not restore (according
to the plan in this volume proposed) the Opera Horatiana
to that order of books in which it is highly probable at
least that they were first published by the poet himself. He
revolutionises every thing; and exults in the magnificent
mischief. ’ “ De toutes les pieces d'Horace je‘n'en laisse {lue
trois dans leur ancienne situation.'' p. vi. ’

Now' I am duly aware that the celebrated D'Orville (in
the year 1750) left on record the severest condemnation of
this barbarous concern. “ Sanadon,” he says, ‘⁶ qui nuper
Horatium temerario ausu Absyrti instar concidit trunca-
vitque‚ et triviali commentario obruit.” D'Orville ad Cha-
riton, p. 239. ed. Beck. “

K cotzius too, in his Lectiones Venusinae (1770), speaks of
Sanadon's conceitedness at once and servile plagiarism in a
strong tone of bitterness. Take the following examplesi
“ Sanadonius interpretatur mire, et explicat defenditque ¹ver-
sionem perperam, ut fere sempe-r, quoties aliorum animad-
versiones non compilavit.'' p. 321.—“ Sanadonio, servilis
'ingenii homine, cuique nihil magis succedit, quam si Bent-
leium aliosque compilat.‘’' p. 406.

To these severe expressions most probably Dr. Parr
re'fers in the very elever and very playful Letter to Mr.
Henry Homer on his projected variorum Edition of Horace.
After calling him “a great coxcomb'' in one part of it, he
