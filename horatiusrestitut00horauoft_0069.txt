Non solum facto, verum opprobrio quoqtie turpi:

Nec tim'uit, sibi ne vitio quis verteret olim,

Si praeco parvas, aut (ut suit ipse) coactor

We have next to contemplate Horace in a new light, as
trained under his father's eye to become the future Censor
and Satirist of that avarieious and luxurious, that volup-
tuous and yet superstitious age, amidst all its passions
labouring under the fear of death, the epidemic of that day.
For the Epicurean philosophy, however ingeniously recom-
mended by Lucretius, and in its grand practical maxim
adopted by virgil,

Geo. 11. 491, 2. Atque metus omnes et inexorabile fatum
Subjecit pedibus, strepitumque Acherontis avari.

was poorly calculated to console by its prospect of annihi-
lation those who clung to life for its sensual indulgences: as
little was it adapted to administer to a mind diseased with
the cons‘ciousness of crime or the cravings of avarice. In
the language of J ob, XVI. 2. might not such victims feelingly
exelaim “we have heard many such things; miserable com--
forters are ye all.''

In his very earliest efforts as an Author, when he apolo-‹
gises for the freedom exercised on the follies and vices of
those around him, Horace gives all the credit of that che-
rished inclination, very distinctly, to the wise Iessons of his-
admirable parent; and that too after djsclaiming any tole-»
ration for personal malignity in the very strongest terms.
