THE SAPPHIC STANZA.

(1, 2, 3.) The Sapphic verse commonly so called:
(4.) The Adonic verse, - υ ν - ε ,

Δ. Jam satis terris Ι nivis atque dirae
Grandinis misit pater, et rubente
Dextera sacras jaculatus ηοω,

Terruit urbem.

The first three verses have their scansion thus,

-υ-- -υυ- υ-ῦ

‘tile Epitritus secundus and the choriambus, followed by
Bacchius (ν- -) οι· Αωρὶῑίῢταοὴ(υ-ν), as in the close of
Metre X, the Sapphicus major.

ἓ On comparing this Metre with that, the difference will at
,ἐξ once be seen to consist in one choriambus more or less-

{- Thus,

« ’ 1, Ο. vnx. 6. Inter aequales equitat, Gallica nec lupatis . . .
isaltered into the common Sapphic by an omission to that
3 amount.

ἓ Inter aquales equitat lupatis.

Ξ Its structam-e generally coincides with that of (A.) the first
5 line above. Sometimes, however, it admits this variation,
ξ Β. ι c. x. 1. Mercuri, sumnam nepos ι Atlanti.. ..

§ud this, but less frequently,

C. 4 C. ιι. 33. concines majore Ι Poeta Ι plectro.

And the only clear deviation from one or other of these

&forms occurs in describing the dithyrambic boldness of
Pindum
