form of the Sapphic here marked (B) is very sparingly,
some seven times in all, introduced. In the third book,
though otherwise (it will be seen) distinguished as an era
in Horace's alteration of the Alcaic, not a single departure
from the form (A) of the Sapphic line is anywhere ad-
mitted; while the form (C) has never yet appeared at all,
Pass to the Carmen Saeculare and vhe fourth book; and you
find the form (C) for the first time introduced, with the
form (B) more largely than before, contributing to the im-
provement and variety of the stanza.

Under these circumstances, let us look to the Nouvelle
Distribution (already alluded to, P. D. p. 13) devised by
M. Sanad0n; and see whether he bestows any notice
either on the progessive stages, so well defined, by which
Horace carried that lyrical metre to its ultimate perfection, v
or on the temporary doubt, betrayed in his third book,
whether he was right or not in admitting the first step of
variety. In the face of these striking facts then, as now to
us they must appear, demonstrating the separate entire-
ness of the third book from those before, and from the
fourth book with the Carmen Saeculare which followed, M.
Sanadon, on a fancied plan of his own, tears the whole
twenty-six Sapphic Odes (except a few omitted) from all
their ancient neighbourhood, and scatters them ad libitum,
far and wide, over his nouvelle distribution ,Ι

After tracing with this exactness the commencement, the
halt 01· retrograding, and the satisfactory close, of Horace's
career in Sapphic versification, it remains briefly here to
show on what general ratio of the different modes of struc-
¹ture any composition in that metre should be formed, so as
best ‚to coincide with the practical model of the Poet's own
ἱ mature judgment. The Carmen Saeculare then, one of his
two longest Odes in that verse, may be fairly taken for the
purpose3 and with sufficient accuracy of proportion, itpre-
sents the following result, to combine-more or less, in every
