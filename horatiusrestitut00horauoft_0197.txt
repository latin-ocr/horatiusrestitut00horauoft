verse (3) has this scansion

-UU- -

The last syllable* is always long; and twicb only with
hiatus, in a long vowel, 1 C. xx111. 3. 8. a nicety not much
observed by later writers of this Horatian stanza.

In the verse (3) also, the just collocation of the accents
may not be neglected; which Casimir, however, has once
or twice disregarded.

For instance, ’

4 Lyric- xxvnt. 7. Βεριέιωυε, puer6rum . . .

is accented in a way quite unknown to Horace: it has the
very same cadence with the Ionic a minore, Tenerdrum
pnerdrum‚ a different species of verse; and though with the
sanie quantity, is as unlike as can be imagined to (l C. v. 7.)
