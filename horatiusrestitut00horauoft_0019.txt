high birth. From whence, it may be asked, did this ad-
junct of nobility and opulence arise, which so marked civil
society in the age of Augustus? Clearly enough, its origin

, was military, in the custom for young men of family to go

out'as contubernales to commanders in chief and governors
of provinces, and under their eye to learn all the virtutes
imperatorias whether of provincial policy or of the art of
war.
. The authority of Cicero for the military practice in his
day is very explicit. Take two instances as presented by
Ernesti in his valuable Indeoe Latinitatis. Pro Cn.
Plancio, δ 11. and Pro M. Coelio, ξ 30. it is stated as a
fact highly honourable to their characters, that the one en-
joyed the contubernii necessitudo with Aulus Torquatus,
and that the other went into Africa to be Q. Pompeio Pro-.
consuli contubernalis. For a period not much later, the
words of Horace may be considered sufficiently clear, as
when at 1 S. v11. 25. he mentions the comites of Brutus,
and at 1 Ε. vm. 2. he writes to Celsus Albinovanus, comiti
scribaeque Neronis, with the cohors also of that young
prince (v. 14) alluded to. In a brief sketch like this, one
more example, but that of a splendid name, may suffice.
The young Agricola, as we are told by Tacitus, ξ 5. Prima
castrorum rudimenta Suetonio Paullino diligentiae moderato
duci approbavit, electus, quem contubernio aestimaret.
Now, by what process the transition took place from the
contubernalis of the Praetorium abroad to the comes of the
mansion or the villa at home, it may be a difficult office to
develope. But the two Epistles, xvn. and xv111. to Scaeva
and to Lollius, (of which the latter supplies the term comi--
tem, v. 30. in sequence to dives amicus, v. 24. as the cor-
relative, followed by potentis amici, v. 44. in the same
meaning,) abundantly demonstrate, that the relation of
such a minor to such a major amicus prevailed much in the
highest Roman society, at the time when Horace wrote
