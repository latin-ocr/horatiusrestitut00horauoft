&omposition we find also intimated in the following passage,

1 S. x. 31—35. Atque ego oum Graeoos facerem, natus mare eitra,

During his stay in Athens that city would doubtless· gra-
tify his natural taste for retirement, as the Vacuum Tibur
(1 E. vn. 45.) afterwards did in more settled indulgence.

Horace might in 13.c. 45. have formed acquaintance with
the son of Cicero, somewhat his senior, who was sent to
Athens in the April of that year: but not a vestige exista
of any such fact. The Messala and Bibulus, so. splendidly
grouped in the list of his friends, 1 S. x. 81—-6, &c., (a Lo·
oua Classiam in the biography of Horace,) we 'may fairly
presume to have been there and well known to h'im; for
Tully tells us, that two young men of those very names,
very soon after his son went, were going to that celebrated
seat of learning‘.

Of all the Sodales of Horace, however, not one seems to
have been' more dearly beloved by him, and in all proba-
bility on an early friendship, commenced (as we say) when
at Oolleqe t'oyetlcer, than Pompeius Varus ‚· who must on
,ιιο account be confounded with Pompeius Grosphus, a very
worthy man, who at that time (2 C. xvi. 33.) and several
years after (1 E. x11. 22.) resided in Sicily. This Pom-
peius, distinguished also on good authority by the cognomen
Vme, (vid. Torrentius‚) was just then happily restored
