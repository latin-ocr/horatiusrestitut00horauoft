PART 111.
LIFE AND CHARACTER.

 

A sxurcu of the principal facts and circumstances in
'the early life of Horace, especially where that tends to
illustrate the formation of his character as afterwards seen in
'his wridngs, shall next be attempted.

The father of Horace, after ⁴having gained hizs freedom

in the family from which that distinguished name was
derived to his son, was doubtless for many years afterwards
in the laborious and profitable office (1 S. vx· 86.) of a
Coae-tor at sales by auction ; and had gathered together a
considerable property by success in that employment.
- At this period of the Roman Commonwealth‚ the condi—
tion of the Libertini was fast rising to that importance on
account of its wealth‚ which afterwards excited so much
indignation in the Inyenui, whose poverty was embittered
by their pride: an indignation, be it observed‚ neither
merited nor reasonable. Whoever now reads in Tally
(Offices. L. 1. C. 42.) Jam de artificiis et quaeste‘bus qui
liberales habendi, qm· sordidi sint, &Q will in a moment
discern, that so many lucrative and not necessarily dis-
graceful employments‚ given up entirely ἰο men of servile
origin, must have lowered and lessened the class of old
citizens without raising a class of new to occupy their rank
and their influence in the state: the vacuum in fact was
very imperfectly and very unhappily filled up.
