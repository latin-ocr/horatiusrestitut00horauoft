viii PREFACE

*In the dedication of Horatius Restitutus, here preserwd‘,
it will not be considered as an extravagant. compliment, if 1
have styled Dr. Bentley the Prince of Critias. For what
is the constant language of the present generation, and
amongst the scholars of the Continent ? Hermann, himself
confessedly, ‘⁶ a scholar and a philosopher of the highest
order,'' in one of his critical works, De R. Bentleio ejusque
editione Terentii Dissertatio, tells us distinctly, that from
his preceptor, F. V. Reiz, he inherited the disposition to
honour Bentley, tanquam pezfeclissimum critici exemplum .·
and he has admirably concentered his own eulogy of that
character in the following definition which he afterwards -
expands.

“ Erat Bentleius {sir infinitae doctrinae, acutissimi sensus,
acerrimi judicii. Et his tribus rebus omnis laus et virtus
continetur Critici.''
