great change of age and character, which the Author had
undergone in 'that interval betwixt· the last date of his Satires
and the first of his Epistles‚ the wonder is that any idea
should have occurred to a Scholar like MORGENSTERN of
writing a formal treatise De Satira> atque Epi-stoke Hora-
tianoe discrimine (Lipsiae, 1801.); when perhaps, unless
from the Epistles immediately following the Satires as
hitherto published, even he, aware as he was of Bentley's
arrangement, would hardly have thought either of contrast
σι’· 'of compar-ison between them. U nquestionably‚ however,
Morgenstern has rendered one great service to the cause
advocated in these pages: no reader of his elegant and ge-
nerallyjudicious Essay will ever again be misled by the juxta·
position of the Satires and Epistles to consider the latter
as a continuation merely of the former. That source of
error and confusion is now finally closed.

To go on with the real succession of Horace's works here
, recommended to the Scholar's notice; not only, as it has
been well observed, “ is the writer of the Epistles''—from
the “ moral turn '' of the composition generally—‘⁶ discerned
in the Odes:” but more particularly we may discover also
somewhat of the same dexterity with which his Odes are
osten concluded, in the abrupt but happy conclusion of many
of his Epistles. In both classes of writing Horace seldom
seeks or regards any plan of regular termination. After
saying what he principally thought of saying when he set
out, whenever he finds himself arrived at some point which
supplies apiquant or pleasant mode of dropping the subject,
there he suddenly slips away from his reader; leaving him
on the one hand to recall in quick review the train of images
which had just been passing before his mind, or on the other,
to wind up the argument in its practical inference for him-
self, with the less of offence given to his vanity and self-love.

To exemplify all this by adducing the passages at full,
would bc a work of labour. The Odes abound with cndings
