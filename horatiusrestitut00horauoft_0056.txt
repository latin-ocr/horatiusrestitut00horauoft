(32) PRELIMINARY DISSERTATION·

his epistle to Torquatus, 1 Ep. ν.,) even so late as Julius
Caesar's birth-day, the loth of J uly.

In one word, then, what is the plain inference from all
this? Phidyle (whether a real person or in part imaginary)
must be considered as a yeoman's wife in the neighbourhood
of Tivoli. Such a person we may well suppose to have been
the pudica mulier (Ep. 11. 39.) elsewhere described3 and,
innoc-enee of character being therefore presumed, we have
only to take immunis at the beginning-of that fine stanza,

Immunis aram . . . . . . mica,

in its natural sense of costless, with little or no eost ; which
Casaubon (Persian. Imit. Horat. ad S. 11. 75.) and Bentley
(in loc.) agree in maintaining against the vulgar interpre-
tation of innocent, as unauthorized as it is unnecessary.

But we have not yet done with this Ode. From Tivoli
or the high grounds near it, Phidyle might probably see
Alqidum or Alba (vv. 9—11). In the Sabine valley, the
Villica of Horace (if such a person there was) most assuredly
could see nothing of the kind; and was far too remote to
hear anything of places like those. There would have
been a violation of all nature and probability in addressing
such an Ode, even nomine tenus, to a person so circum-
stanced. 1

‘rhen too, (v, 16,) from whence was the myrtle to come?
from the same genial soil which yielded the rose, the ivy,
the apium, and the vine; from the mite solum Tiburis
(1 C. xvnl. 2.), to be sure.

(3.) On similar internal evidence to that contained in
the two Odes, (already considered‚) 4 C. XI, and 3 C. xxn1.
I should date in Tivoli the invitation to Quinctius Hir-
pinus, 2 C. xx.
