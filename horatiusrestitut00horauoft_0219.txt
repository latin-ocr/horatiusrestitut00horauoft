We have here to remark a singular change in the practice of
Horace.

The form (D) above described appears very seldom in the
let and 2d books: in the 3d and 4th it became so much a
favourite as to appear nearly 10 times as often.

2D. »υ-Ι..Ι-.--

differs from the-precedent only by its ending in one quadri· q
syllabic insteadssof two dissyllabic words; and the few in-
stances of it are evenly dispersed over the four books.

3 C. xxrx. 8. Telegoni Ι juga Ι parricidae.
4 C. xv. 28. Rite deos Ι prius {appr-effati.

2 Canu. 4. Perniciem Ι opprobriumque Ι pagi.
3 C. xxxu. 20. Farre pio Ι ἐι saliente Ι mica.

Here also the change in Horace's practice is singular, but in
the opposite direction to that of D. The instances‚ not
many in all, occur three times as often in the first two books
asin the two latter: the form had apparently gone out os
favour with him.

F and 2 F are forms similar enough to be classed to-
gether.
