PaEmMiNAnY DlssERTAT10N; (81)

Bentley for the composition of his several books, shall here
be given; and that not only as a clue to guide the reader
through the details of the Dissertation, but also as a help
in referring to the columns of ΜΓ. Clinton's invaluable
Fasti.

It will be necessary, however, to premise, that Bentley⁹s
years of the life of Horace, here printed in Roman figures,
were by him calculated in a peculiar way. Thus the year
of Horace's nativity‚ Β. c. 65. though he was born in the
last month of it, in Bentley's reckoning stands as the year
1 of his age, the year after it as Π, and so on to the end of
Horace's life. .

Instead of taking the natal year, Mr. Clinton makes
Β. c. 64. the first of his calculation, that is the current year
till completed in December.

In the following happy sketch given by Horace of his
character and personal history, (and it has not been adduced
before..) how ingeniously does he contrive to afford the
calculation of his age, by giving the year Β. c. 21. though
now past, stom its commodiousness for expressing in verse
as well the period of his own life (44) as the consular names
belonging to it.

l E. xx. 20-28. Me libertino natum patre, et in tenui re,
Majores pennas nido extendisse loqueris ς
Ut quantum generi demas, virtutibus addas ς
Me primis urbis belli placuisse domique;
Corporis exigui, praecanum, solibus aptum3
Irasci celerem, tamen ut placabilis essem.
Forte meum si quis te percontabitur aevum,
Me quater undenos sciat implevisse Decembrem,
Colleyam Lepidum quo duxit Lollius anno.

· No attempt is here pretended to exhibit an exact chro—
nology of Horace's life with a regular parallel to it in the
events of Roman history, and in the incidents which mark
the biograpliy« of contemporarypoets. Adesideratum like
