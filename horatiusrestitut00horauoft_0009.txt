ΤΟ THE FIRST EDITION.

 

IN the Dissertation here prefixed to this Book of Horatius
Restituta& I am duly sensible, that the idea may arise of
something irregular and desultory in the composition of it.·
Let me candidly own, that I should have been very happy
td meet the expectation of my readers with a performance
more regular and systematic, if the peculiarity of the sub-
ject had more readily allowed me so to do. ’
, > According to my own impressions, first of all, that sub-
ject itself was so extensive at once and full of variety, that
with a little elegant diffusion, (which in its occasional use 1
am far from disparaging,) the materials of this Dissertation
might be expanded easily into a separate volume: *and in
the second place, from the very nature of some of the dis-'
quisidons, necessarily dry, however to the purpose essential,
certain breaks of a pleasanter kind seemed desirable, to re· ,
lieve the formality of argument, if that might be done with-
out the discursive itself becoming tedicus.

The straightforward plainness, however, of the great

Α points to be proved, may serve, amidst so much detail, to

excuse the want .0f' methodical regularity in the process.
That Horace published his collected writings from time to
time in such an order of succession and in no other, and that
his principal residemes, after he became a professed Poet,
were three determinate places of abode, neither more, nor
less; these surely are questions, which (when aided by the
Chronological Table here subjoined) will hardly alarm the
mind of an intelligent reader with any apprehension of per-
plexity.
