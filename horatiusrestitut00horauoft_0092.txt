, In passing to the Epodes, very little appears for remark
to my purpose which is not already forestalled. We have
seen Horace carry the Poems of Archilochus with him for
study and imitation into the Sabine valley. And as we
know the severe model of correctness in writing which he
laid down for himself and enforeed upon others, the conclu-

task‚ when he afterwards expresses such pride in the execu-

Non aliena meo pressi pede .- qui sibi fidit,
Dux regit examen. Parios ego primns lambos

Ostendi batim numeros animosque secutus
Archilochi, non res et agentia Verba chamben.

By the bye, Horace has paid himself a compliment hest}
which truth does not warrant. Canidia alone might testify‚
that when in the Parian vein, Horace wanted neither talent
nor bitterness to drive a Lycambes mad.

On the historical bearing of the book of Epodes, nothing
can be more satisfactory and singularly distinct than the
paragraph quoted in the Chronological Table ftom Mr.
Clinton's Fasti Hellenici, under the year Β. c. 31. '

'v11. Quo, Jquo scelesti. . . . contemplates the impending war
betwixt Caesar and Antony as yet distant, and with horror
and dismay deprecates such an event. The date of it, there-
fore, must be carried back as far as other considerations will
