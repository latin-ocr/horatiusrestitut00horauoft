was either a continuation of the former, or arose as a reply
out o'f Scaeva's supposed answer to it.

Now is it not clear, on a close comparison, that Lollius,
being a young' man of rank, the son of a vir consularis, hot
and high-spirited, was liable to offend by want of due com'-
plaisance? With his natural brusquerie and his fits of con-
tradictory or unaccommodating humour, he was the most
unlikely man in Rome (scurrantis speciem praebere) to be
mistaken for a sycophant. Scaeva, on the other hand, timid
apparently and somewhat necessitous himself, with relatives
perhaps ill provided for, while he required encouragement
to undertake the office of living with the great, might stand
no less in need of delicate cantion, how to improve his for-
'tunes as the comes (v. 52) to a rex (v, 43) without meanness
and without importunity.

This view of the matter Ι am happy to find confirmed by
Wieland as quoted with approbation by Morgenst'ern, in a
Dissertation to be noticed more particularly by and by.
After remarking the skill of Horace in similibus argumentis
tractandis, he refers for illustration of it to these very Epis-
tles3 Sic Epistolae ad Scoevam et Lollium eandem docent
cum principibus vivendi artem: at quam callide diverso
utrimque inyenio et conditioni attemperantur praecepta!

The vth Epode on Canidia, is by several others separated

,from the xvuth on the same Beldame: evidently to keep ⁷

the pathetic and the horrible apart in reading from the in-
vective and ironical.

And to take another example from the same family :

The two Odes (l G. xvl, xv11.) Omatre pulchra, ὅτε. and
Velooe amoemcm, διο. are now generally considered as ad-
dressed to one person, the daughter of Canidia, (or Grati-
dia‚) under the Greek name of Tyndaris. Assuming as a
fact what is most highly probable, then, in the position of
the apology first and of the invitation immediately afterwards,
