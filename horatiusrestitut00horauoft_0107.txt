’ several objections immediately disappear; as others again
· may be· overeome by considerations of a different kind.

’ 1'. A‘n‘d first of all, to take a strong instance.
> When the death of Virqil is by Mr. Clinton assigned to
«Β. o. 19. an acute objector may ask; how, then, could an
'Ode'of invitation to Virgil (4 C. ΧΠ.) Jam veris comites,
δια, γμ’»εείωγ be written in any of the years Β. c· 17, 15.

’ the very cancelli within which Bentley has fixed the com-

positiones the fourth book of Odes? My answer is this,
(and Mr. Clinton thinks it just ⁴and satisfactory,) that
Horace, after publishing the third book of Odes in B. c.
23 or 22. had evidently imagined his lyric labours then
concluded: nor had he any design‚ apparently, till called
upon by Augustus several years after, to resume the task of
the lyre. But in the interval which ensued, what should
hindei· him when writing a playful and in some peculiar
touches (vV. 15, 25.) rather a keen address to virgil, from
using once more the lyric stanza? Its insertion afterwards
in the fourth book of Odes was all natural enough:
it 'would else never have been known to exist. For the
old Scholiast tells us on the Ode (lv) Qualem minis-
inm, διο. Haec est ecloya propter quam totus hic libe-r
compositus est. And Gesner's sensible remark who had no
hypothesis to serve, has been already quoted: cum semel
placuisset novum librum edere, in eum conjectum esse
quidquid ad manus esset.

2. The death of Quintilius Varus Cremonensis, that in-
comparable critic and friend, that censor honestus,

(A. Ρ. 438. Quintilio si quid recitares, ᾀο.)

to whose integrity of advice and severity of taste the two

great poets were so much indebted‚ is lamented by Horace

in a tone of the deepest feeling and regi-et, 1 C. xxw. Ad

Virgilium, Quis desiderio sit pudor, ὅτε. The year assigned

to that event by Hieronymus (F. H. p. 237ss) is Β. c, 24.
