It is not, therefore, from high-flown praises like these
bestowed on the uncivilized character in spite, as it were, to
the degener-acy of the civilized, that one would think of
deriving any trustworthy evidence to exalt the rural popu-
lation of Italy. To the testimony of Virg'il‘and of Horace
also, on the other hand, when directly and sincerely lauding
that moral excellence which they had themselves witnessed
in the country pebple around them, no exception can be taken.
Beyond recording the plain truth, as in itself delightful to
contemplate, they could have no intelligible ‘motive for over-
colouring the picture, except in the pure and patriotic love

Cui tolerare colo vitam tenuique Minerva
Impositum, cinerem et sopitos suscitat ignes,
Noctem addens operi3 famulasque ad lumina longo
Exercet penso 3 castum ut servare cubile
Conjuqis, et possieparvoe educere natos.
