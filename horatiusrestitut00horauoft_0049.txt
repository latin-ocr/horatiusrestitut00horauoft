‘⁶ For as Horace invites Maecenas from Rome to his
Tibur, it seems inconceivable that he should press him to
make haste, lest he should be always taking a view of Tibur.
How much properet would it have been to recommend his de-
parture from Rome that he might enjoy the scenes of Tibur!
I therefore change NE to UT. N. H.''

To a great variety of disquisifions, more or less intelligent
and entertaining on this text and on the topics naturally
connected with it, the references below given ὃ will direct the
reader; if any of the books happen to be within his reach.
But here it may be as well to add, however, that the combin-
ation of semper with udum, so essential to the establish-
ment of ¹'the new reading, is happily defended not only in
general by his own expression, (1. E. xv111‚ 98‚) Nec te
semper-inops agitet vexetque cupido; but by the specific
authority of Ovid where he describes his natalia rura.-—Fasti

ιν, 686.

Parva sed assiduis uvida semper aquis.

Having thus secured the compliment due to an Etonian
and King's *man for starting the question so vitally important
to the Lyric bard of Tivoli‚ I shall not however proceed on
credit taken for his emendation being true: I shall rather
appeal for corroboration of its truth to the internal evidence
which the lst, 2d, and 3d books of Odes‚ the lst book of
Epistles‚ and the 4th book of Odes in that order, all con-
tribute to yield‚ not only of Horace's often visiting Tivnli,
but of his residing in that quiet town very much and often
during a great part of his latter days.
