and they are variously scattered through the mass and mixt
multitude of the real Carmina. Henthus makes up five
books of Odes altogether ; and, as with an Epilogos to the
whole, concludes the fifth of them with the last ode of our
third book,

Eoeeyi monumentum oere perennius.

Now it is most true that the great Muretus in the year
1551 remarks thus on the book EPODON. “ Cur Epodos
liber hic vocetur, non equidem satis intelligo: ac vidi veterem
librum, in quo hic quintus Odarum liber inscribebatur.'' In
his Var. Lect. too, L. iii. C. xm, he entitles it expressly
thus: ‘⁶ Horatii versus e quinto Odarum illustrati.'' But at
that day, the critical knowledge of Horace was yet in its
infancy ε and Sanadon stands without excuse for not attend-
ing to the Grammatical signification of Epodi‚ when in all
the editions by C‘ruquius from the year-1578 downwards,
the old commentaries on Horace had been regularly pub-

lished with the commentator's clear and explicit definition
of (α) προῳόὄς, and of (β’) ἐπῳδός.

α. Ibis Liburnis inter alta navium,
β. Amice, propugnacula.

That Archilochian metre which from its predominance (and
that of others similar) gave in an early century its own ap-
pellation to the whole book of Epodes, is not at this day
much better understood from Gaisford's Hephaestio, (1810,)
pp. 129. 368. or from Hermann's Elementa Doctrinae
Metricae, (1816,) L, iii. c. xv. than it might have been known
for any practical purpose in the year 1578.

Of all this, however, Sanadon has shown, if not a profound
ignorance, yet a most offensivc contempt. His comment on
’ the very first Epodc‚ Ibis Liburnis, δῖα, he thus introduces,
“ Cette Ode est proprement une lettre en vers liriques !''
No wonder, that an Editor who found lyric Ode-s in what
