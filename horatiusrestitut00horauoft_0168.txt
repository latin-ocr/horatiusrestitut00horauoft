the early date of Β. c. 36, and then places the Satire,
2 S. v1. Hoc eratin votis . . . along with the fact of Horace
getting that property, &in the subsequent 'year B. c, 31.
Whereas in the year Β. c. 36. as we calculate, Horace was
enriched with the Sabine villa by his patron Maecena83 about
n. c. 31. he purchased or rented the cottage at Tivoli3 and
in B. c. 26 or 25. he was putting up the prayer to end his
days in that delightful spot, to which his attachment grew
the more ardent, the longer he knew it.

Such is our account of the matter: such is that of Dr.
Kirchner.

Kirchner's second objection charges Bentley with assert-
ing, that Horace did not give publication to separate pieceS,
but only to whole books at a time. Here distinction is
necessary.

No one denies, nor did Bentley mean to deny, that Horace
must have allowed several of his writings to be known
amongst his friends at the time, either by private recitation,
or by giving copies of some pieces, just as they were written.
From hence a partial publicity would be acquired; as
unquestionably was the case with two of his Satires, from the
mention of Rufillus, 1 S. 11. 27. compared with 1v. 92. and
of Lucilius 1 S· 1v. 8, 9. compared with 1 S. x, 1. The
collective publication of the pieces afterwards in separate
books is all that we contend for.

And as to the third head of objection, that Bentley is
wrong in asserting Horace to have published the books
separately one by one, and not more than one book at a time:
a sufficient answer on that head has been virtually given, in
considering the principal point of it, whether the first,
second, and third books of Odes could be, as Kirchner
