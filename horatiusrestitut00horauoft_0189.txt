others, the Romans may seem to have admitted a secondary
necent on the first syllable: a supposition which would re—

store propriety to the following verse,
Ep. 11. 13. Simul calentis inverecundus deus.

It remains to be noticed as a singular fact, that of verses
constructed like

Ep. 1. 7. Utrumne jussi Ι persequemur Ι otium,

many examples occur in Terence as his Prologues alone may
testify, in the Epodes of Horace, and in the Fables of Phae-
drus; yet in the Tragedies which bear the name of Seneca,
not a single instance can be found of a verse constituted
like that above.

Iambic dimeter (2).
The scansion of this verse as to its predominant and ad-
missible feet ι

“ In the dimeter the w— initial, though from the trimeter not
excluded‚ seems inadmissible. Casimir Sarbievius uses it,

Epod. 1. 18. Metuenda jaceret fulmina.

As to the structure, itis worthy of observation, that a
verse from its ‘composition aceented like the following,

C. Sarb- ΕΡ. v. 2. Non nudus ensium timor,

though a just dimeter as to quantity, is never found in Ho-
race, nor in any author of the early ages. .

Now as the iambus itself is used freely in the third place,
this combination might have occurred very often, if it had
not been purposely avoided. In what then does the faulti-
nese of that line consist? Clearly in this, that it bears the
accentualrcadence peculiar to a very different kind of verse,
the Glyconie: of which verse,

4 (Σ. 111. ll. Et spissa* nemorum coinae.
