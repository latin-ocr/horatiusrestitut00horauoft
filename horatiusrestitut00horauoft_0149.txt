 

ou AUGUSTUS cAESAn. (125)

what else do we read, but that those followers of Brutus,
young, ardent, and ‘brave‚ did not realise on the field of
· battle that high confidence of success with which they ap-
proached it. At all events, the attribute of military prowess,

elsewhere accorded to the victorious side, as in Horace's
own words,

2 E. n. 47, 8. civilisque rudem belli tulit aestus in arma
Caesaris Augusti non responsura lacertis.

might surely be coneeded by the vanquished party.

But, in truth‚ for the natural result of that as of the other
great engagements in the civil war, (Pharsalia, Philippi,
Actium,) Tacitus, when he has occasion to allow the com-
mencement in the East to be so far inauspicious to V espa—
sian's enterprise, furnishes at once the brief solution: the
conquerors in each conflict had the old soldiers of the West
on their side.

Hist. 11. 6. Namque olim validissima inter se civium arma,
in Italia Galliave, viribus Occidentis coepta. Et Pompeio,
Cassio, Bruto, Antonio, quos omnes trans mare secutum est
civile bellum, haud prosperi exitus fuerant.

Aster the battle of Philippi, so fatal to the republican
cause, when in the terse and pointed language of Tacitus,
Annal. 1. 2. “Bruto et Cassio caesis, nulla jam publica
arma‚” and more especially when after some happy years,
in which, under Maecenas's wing, Horace had enjoyed at
Rome the literary leisure which he loved; his attachment
then to the cause of Caesar rather than to that of Antony‚
on the quai-rel between those competitors for empire bursting
out into war, cannot surely be wondered at, much less does
it require any excuse. Yet even then, though he has de-
voted au Ode to Cleopatra, a total silence regarding the
name of Antony in whatever he wrote, marks the delicacy
which he has observed on all subjecte of political dissension.
“ Nor on any occasion,” to use the words of Mr. Dunlop,
