(104) APPENDIX 1.

Before we dismiss this description of Horace's familiar
day, which has unavoidably run to a great length of detail,
two or three additional remarks may suffice to conclude the
subject.

A course of daily life like that here delineated could
hardly be supposed to glide along without considerable
varieties. One such, and of frequent occurrence probably, is
presented to us in the Satire, 1 S. 1x. Ibam forte Via
,ςαονᾶ . . . Horace must have taken that walk into the city
some two hours before the usual time that he quitted his
morning couch: for when he and his tormentor had gone as
far as the Temple of Vesta, the fourth part of the day then
having elapsed (v. 35. quarta jam parte diei Ι Praeterita) it
would be nine o'clock of our reckoning3 which seems to
involve a different disposition of the forenoon altogether.

Nor are we to imagine that Horace did not occasionally
take his share abroad in the morning duties of common life.
The qffi'ciosa sedulitas in attending levees (1 E. vn. 8.) ,
and the opella forensis in giving bail for a friend, ὅτε. (ibid.)
were certainly not unknown to him. For the salutandi
plures (1 S. v1. 101.) is what he deprecates as one of the
troubles consequent on the supposition of a higher parentage;
and the words, 2 S. VI. 27. quod mi obsit, clare certumque
locuto, after answering in the court, to my own detri-
ment, perhaps, may fairly attest that his good nature now
and then intanglcd him in the losses which proverbially
belong to suretyship in all ages of the world. A kind-
hearted manlike Horace, therefore, would understand very
well what it meant, ⁷*

A. -Ρ, v. 423. Spondere levi pro paupere . . .

nor could he to the supposed son of opulence have put the
touching question,

2 S. 11. 103. Cur eget indignus quisquam, tedivite?
