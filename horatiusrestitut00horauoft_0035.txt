 

CHRONOLOGY or· wonxs. (11)

Horace himself denominated (Ep. Χιν. 7. cf. 1 Ε. x1x.
23-25.)

Inceptos, olim promissum carmen, lambos,

should become enamoured of his own inventions and create
a chaos accordingly.

It is true indeed, that among his lyric odes, Horace has
not scrupled to insert some pieces in a metre not strictly
lyric: as, 1 C. lv, v11, v111, xxv1113 2 C. xv1113 3 C.
111 3 4 C. vn. But then among the Epodes there is
nothing lyrical whatsoever ; of. itself‚ surely, a decisive
fact, that to the odes, a higher class of poetry, he did not
devote his mind at all till a later period.

And here it may be observed‚ that the word carmen,
though specifically applied to lyris: odeS, as 2 Ε. 11, 59.

that in the Epodes; and that in the Epistle to Augustus,

the use of that word, independently of circumstances in the

auspicious day of his migration into the Sabine Valley: that
day formed an era in the happineSS‚ in the moral as well as
literary character of his life.

Henceforth, of course, we find him much less resident at
Rome3 and when occasionally there, annoyed with matters
*of business, invisa negotia, 1 E. XIV. 17, and, aliena,
2 S. VI, 33, on the Esquiline, to a much greater degree than
before3 or at any rate he likes so to represent it.

All that new delight of his in the rus and villula among
the Sabines, in the scenery which adorned his estate, and in
the shrewd and virtuous people into whose society it thrcw

him, Horace exquisitcly describes in the vnh Satire of the
2d book,
