come, in the let, 7th and 19th Epistles of that most curious
and valuable book. As establishing the character of Horace
on the basis· of sincerity and independence even under the
deepest sense of obligatiom that one Epistle (vn.) Quinque
dies tibi pollicitus, ἄτη, which apologizes for his protracted
aboence in the country during the hot season‚ remains a
lasting and beautiful monument. Nor in the evidence which
it bears to the sterling good sense and high-minded gene-
rosity of Maecenas, is it to be regarded as reflecting less
honour, but if possible more, on that (with all his foibles)
most excellent man. We are morally sure, that the vuth
Epistle was 'published by Horace himself in the life time of
both. What then, in any age, should be the estimation of
the Poet who could address, and of the Patron who could
receive—publicly too, let it be added—the frank and affec—
tionate boldness of language like this ?

vv. 33. 39. Macra cavum repetes arctum, quem macra subisti.
Hac ego si compellor imagine, cuncta resigno:
Nec somnum plebis laudo satur altilium, nec
Otia divitiis Arabum liberrima muto.
Saepe verecundum 'laudasti ς Rexque Paterque
Audisti coram, nec verbo parcius absens:
Inspice, si possum donata reponere laetus.

But to return to the question : how comes it, that in the
fourth book of Odes, the name of Maecenas occurs once only
(x1. 19) and then by oblique introduction Ρ

Whoever has perused with any care the various addresses
to Maecenas in every style of writing down to that splendid
