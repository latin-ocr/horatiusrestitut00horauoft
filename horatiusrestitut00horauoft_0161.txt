my excuse be pleaded in the passage recently quoted from
Pliny or in that picture of the recitator acerbus with which
the Epistle to the Pisos is concluded.

’ ‹Eirst of all then, private recitation of the Poet to a few
friends, as we gather from 1 S. tv, 73. or to Augustus, as
'some other Poets did, 2 E. 1. 223, and 1 Ε. x1x. 43, or to a
friendly critic like Quintilius, A. P. 438, was practised by

’ Horace himself. And thus, young Piso (vv. 387, 8) is ad-

 

vised to submit his compositions in the first instance to the ’
criticism of Maecius and his father and Horace.

⁶ Secondly, other Poets did not scruple to recite their writ-
ings at the. common bath or even in the Forum, (1 S. 1v.
74, 5), or to bribe a low audience for a public recitation
1 E. mx. 37, 8).

Thi'rdly, some authors made interest with the masters of
schools to get their poetry into daily use by dictation3 a
practice which Horace mentions with great disdain. (1 S.
x. 74, 5. 1 Ε. xlx. 39, 40.) ν

And lastly, then, as Horace at an early period evidently

disliked to make his pieces known by the usual way of reci- '

tation (1 S. ιν. 23.), so on reaching the advanced maturity
o'f authorship‚ his pride lay in being read <1 E. xm. 34) by
the respectable few3 and of course he took the higher mode
'only ofpublishing by means of the bookseller. That Epistle
(xx.) Ad Librum suum, accordingly, will reward the perusal:
it is full of amusing and curious particulars.

Whatever honour has been attached to the name of
LoLmus (the Consul of Β. c. 21.) by that splendid Ode, 4, lx.
Nesorte credas . . . . may well be received as the tribute of
sincerity and truth from his admit-ing and devoted friend;
especially when the date of its composition is considered,
· some 15 years before the time when Augustus entrusted
him with the personal care and military education of his
