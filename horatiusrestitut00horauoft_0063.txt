Of course, potens here is interpreted of Horace in that
higher sense which the words, Virtus et favor et linqua po-
tentiam 1 Vatum. 4. C. v111. 26, 7. so aptly convey, and
which sense of potency Horace in fact claims to himself m
the very next ode, vv. 30, 1, when he thus addresses Lol-
lius; ——non ego te meis Ι Chattis inornatum silebo, διο.
4 C. 1x. 1—4. Ne forte credas interitura, quae

We find him, however, in a passage to which the emend-
ation Arqivae (vid. R. Β. in loc.) gives the required distinction
and contrast‚ combine even with an epithet of his local
oriyin, a designation of proud eminence as the lyric poet of
Rome.

In B. c. 63. (the year famous for the Consulship of Tully
and the Plot of Catiline) there came to Rome where he
taught, “ majore fama quam emolumento !” a very celebrated
Schoolmaster3 Orbilius Pupillus Beneventanus, better
known as the Playosus Orbilius (2 E. 1. 70, 1.) under
whose chastising hand Horace, on being carried from his
native place to that city, was destined first to smart and to
learn.

No idea is here entertained of hitting the exact year for
that extraordinary incident which marked the childhood of
Horace: but some aid may be given to memory, if Β. c. 60.
be assumed for it, the year of the first triumviratc‚ that be-
twixt Pompey, CrassuS, and Caesar.
