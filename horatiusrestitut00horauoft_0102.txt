express a sentiment quite characteristic of his happy though
hutnble competence. But his father had with singular sue-
cess fixed that principle in his son's mind, which regulated
his own3 to malce what he had suffice him :

1 S. 1v. 107, 8. Cum me hortaretur, parce, frugaliter, atque

Agreeably to this, Horace no where betrays the least indi-

want from his means failing (vitio culpave, 2 S. VI. 7): and,
exempt himself from that inordinate love of riches under
which some of his friends laboured, he gently lashes that
passion in them, quite secure from any retaliation or retort.
Thus, for instance, in his Epistle from the Sabine Villa,
Urbis amatores. . . . he addresses Aristius Fuscus, pointedly
enough, on the wisdom of contentment;

l E. x. 44-46. Laetus sorte tua vives sapienter, Aristi ε
Nec me dimittes incastigatum‚ ubi plura
Cogere quam satis est ac non cessare videbor.

Beautiful, however, as these expressions of personal sen-
timent are, and familiar to the readers of Horace, his golden
maxim, NIL ADMIRARI (l Ε. vi. 1) has more strongly ar-
rested general attention, as conveying in two words the whole
secret of moral wisdom; not to set the heart on obJects of

fanciful worth,

· By'attributing overmuch to things
Less excellent. (Par. Lost, vm. 569.)

but to form the just estimate ‘rerum mediocriter utilium,
(1 E. xvnr. 99,) that is, of the non-essentials to happiness.

And may we not nOW, on viewing this part of Horace's
character, particularly as , connected with what we have
seen (p. 31.) of his cheerfully participating in all rural acts
