2 C. xx. 16. A'les, Ι Hyperbore6sque Ι compos.

More than two thirds of all these lines are found as in
the classes A, B, D, to commence with — υ ν - Ι &c.
The class next in number C. consists of those which com·

menee with-vv Ι -υν-Ι &c.

The principal forms embracing nearly the whole number
of 317 have thus been reviewed: of the few that remain, a
short notice m'ay suffice. The form Ι ----- Ι υ·- Ι υ --

1 C. ιι. 8. Ο’ ΤὴαῙίἑι-οῐιε Ι merum Ι di6ta..

occurs very seldom.

In the early books also, a single case of the (here offen·
sive) amphibrach (ν - ν) occurS, thus:

-υιν-νιυ-ιψ
1 C. xw. 12. Teque Ι tuasque Ι ᾶὸοει Ι sor6m. .

and three only of the following.

—- υυυυ ,ἤι’-Η...-

l C. xxx1. 16. Me cichorea Ι levesque Ι mfilvoe.

and 2 C. 1. 36. x111. 8.

Finally, three lines sui yeneris in singularity may speak
for themselves.
