as a name (eodem numero syllabarum et literarum) under
which poetically to·shadow the real Terentia of Maecenu,
may be quoted as another instance of his happily settling a
point which had been well started before. ’

But that Maecenas himself was in any similar way adum-
brated under the name of Malthinus, in the famous
passage, 1 S. 11. 2455.

Dum vitant stulti vitia, in contraria currunt ι
Malthinus tunicis demissis ambulat. . . .

after all the ingenious pleadings and delicate qualifyings
of Buttmann, (u. 8. p. 473.) is what I am quite content to
reject and disbelieve, in such company as that of Lambi- ⁹
nus, Torrentius, Gesner, and Wieland.

Independently, however, of all other consideratione ob-
vious enough regarding the Poet and the Patron, it will
appear, that Chronology has much more to do in deciding
vthis question, than any one hitherto has observet} or sus-

About the date 13. c. 39, when Horace is supposed to

compliment paid to him for a noble sentiment, at the close
of· the Epistle, xlv, 93.

Diserte Maecenas ait:

· ‘⁶ Nec tumulum curo, sepelit natura relictos.’'

· Alte cinctum putes dixisse : habuit enim ingenium et
grande et virile, nisi illud ipse discinxisset—how, let me ask,
are we at all to understand the compliment, if that qma-de
et virile inqenium did not actually belong to him in his earlier
years ? Only allow this plain piece of justice to Maecenas,
perfectly consistent as it is with every thing otherwise known
of him3 and it becomes palpable at once, that the effeminacy
