(186) on ‘nm METREs 01³· HoRAcE„

in the Monthly Review, wrote that critique on S. Butler's
Marcus Musurus, &c.; little or no suspicion seems to have
existed, that the third line of the Alcaic Stanza was any
thing else but an Iambic dimeter with one syllable over,
scanned thus,

0-10-n0— ιυ-ῦ

and in the structure liable to no restrictiori whatsoever.
Even those writers who abstained from the short in the

fifth syllable, which any careful readcr of Horace would na- ’

turally do, indulged every other license in constructing the
verse.

Buchanan and Sarbievius admit the fifth-syllable short
again and again; and besides some faults peculiar to them-
selves, violate freely, though in different degoees, every prin-
cipal rule hereafter mentioned.

As late down as the publication of the Musae Anglieanae,

of which all the Alcaic odes precede in date the year 1711,ι

the general usage allowed that fifth syllable to be occasion-
ally short. Nor was the point otherwise determined‚ ap-
parently, till Dr. Bentley, in that year, pronounced and de-

fended his judgment in editing the following line of Ho-

'sace
5 2 C. xrx. 15. Disiecta non leni ruina..

(and yet more fully, on this verse, for a similar reason,
3 C. 11. l. ’ Angustam, amici, pauperiem pati.)

The practical correction of an error, so old and so commo-
dious, was far from finding its way immediately into the
scholastic exercises of this country.

7. Of the ν - in primo (so very decided is Horace's pre-
ference for the long syllable) not more than ten instances
occur in all the books, and only two in the third and fourth,
thus astbrding, by the bye, another link in that chain of in—
ternal evidence : and in none of those cases does the verse

,Ε
,ί
