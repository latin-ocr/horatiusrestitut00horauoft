(Hist. of Rom. Lit. Vol. 111. p.*232‚) “is the great Pompey:
or his son Sextus, long the chief enemy and rival ofAugustuh
ever mentioned with contumely or disrespect.” The ,only '
exception, perhapS, appears in the lxth Epode‚ where Horace
refers to the convivial joy which a few years before (a-c. 36.)
he had shared with Maecenas on the defeat and flight of
Sextus Pompeius, vv. 7—10.

Ut nuper, actus eum freto Neptunius
Dux fugit ustis navibus,

Minatus urbi vincla, quae detraxerat
Servis amicus perfidis.

Agreeably to the above remark, even that Epode 1v. Lupis

its bitterness, if Maena can be the person attacked, aims the
invective against him, not as the adherent and partisan of
the younger Pompey, butas the> insolent traitor and the
double renegado. On the contrary, to the stern republican
Cato and his Roman virtues, Horace in more than one
splendid passage has borne the testimony of avowed admira-
tion, '

Praeter atrocem animum Catonis.

From that decisive day, Sept. 2, Β. c. 31, postquam bel-
latum apud Actium atque omnem potestatem ad unum
conferri pa'cis interfuit, Tacit. Hist. 1. 1, it may well be
¹excused, if the consideration of public affairs, as bearing on
'Horace's character, be not here pursued any farther. vWe
- have already seen, P. D. 18—20‚ with what honest ardour he
celebrates the glories of Augustus at home and abroad: ‘and
not a breath of suspicion may be cast on gratulation or
panegyric in his later yearS, at a period when the strong
