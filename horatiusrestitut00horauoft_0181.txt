Here, too, the various readings or conjectures, superbus,
superbum, superbo, leave the field fairly open for the ad-
mission of superbis, recommended by Horace's favourite use
of the adjective in the third line, often so preluding to its
noun in the fourth; and what is more remarkable, by that
very* adjective being three times employed by Horace in
the very same relative position.

1 C. xxxv. 3, 4. superbos.. . .triumphos.
——xxxv11. 31, 2. superbo . . . . triumpho.

4 C. xv. 7, 8. superbis Ι Postibus.

(4) 2 C. ξι. 5, 6, 7. Νοη ego, Pauperum
Sanguis parentum, non ego, quem vocant,
Dilecte Maecenas, obib03 &c.

 

Here, if any clear and consistent interpretation could be
devised for the old reading, quem vocas, the potior conditio
possidentis might exclude any pretender from usurping its
place. But the brilliant suggestion of Dr. Bentley, quem
vocant, scilicet homines invidi, (for even so late as 4 C. 111.
16. Et jam dente minus mordeor ἱηυίάο, envy 'was ’ῃοι
quite extinct‚) may now be allowed to come in by acclama-
tion.

One more remark, and Ι have done: and that principally
to introduce a topic hitherto perhaps but slightly touched,
the natural similitude between Horace and Cicero, as belong-
ing to the same age, in the language of literature and of
morals and of civil life, common to both, along with the
illustration, which from that source may be occasionally
derived, to the writings of Horace.

In a well known passage of the ,Epistle to the Pisos, that
old reading,

⁶26, 7. Sectantem levia nervi

 

Deficiunt animique.
