We may now return to Aug-ustus so entitled3 first how-
'ever promising, that a title like that, of sacred majesty, was
not likely at the first to be given as his designation in
common. Accordingly, even-in the second book of Odes it
occurs once only, (2 C. lx. 19, 20.) and that in conjunction
with the name C'aesar: 'in the third book, only once alone

Temporibus, ξ 6,) while it is impossible not to acknowledge
some confirmation thus afforded to his general theory.

sovereignty, whether to hazard or not the safety of the com-
monwealth by restoring the republic.
Horace, we may well believe, was determined by his
honest feelings on the side of tranquillity after such a series
of storms. And his own words,
