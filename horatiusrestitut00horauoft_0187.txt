ou 'rim METRES OF nomnen. (163)

The scansion of the trimeter (1) runs thus, in all its ad-
missible feet, some of them very rarely admitted.

l 2 3 4 5 6
υ- υ- υ- υ- -ν νῦ
υυυυυυυυυυυυ

Το the exclusion of the anapest in 5²⁰ ftom the table
here given (a foot so frequent in the 'Senarii of Seneca)
there are but three instances of apparent objecfion, which
when examined disappear.

Ep. 11. 3⁵. Pavidumque leporem et advenam nqueo gruem,
(which is a very rare instance of a line otherwise irregular.)
Rea'd laqueo in two syllables, as alveo,
⁵¹⁷ 3 C. vn. 28. Tusco denatat alveo.

These two peculiarities,

Ep. v. 79. Priusque colum sidet inferius mari.

..- x1. 23. Nunc gloriantis quamlibet mulierculam,
turning similarly on the vowels, may safely be placed on the
same footing with Virgil's Geo. 11. 482.

Fluviorum rex Eridanus. . . . .

and as that is pronounced Fluvyorum in three syllables, we
need not scruple surely so to pronounce inferyus and mul-

yerculam likewise.

The structure of the trimeter requires a caesura, or divi-
sion of words, aster the penthemimer usually.

υ- υ- υ Η-υ- υ- νῦ

Ep. 11. 1. Beatus illellqui procul negotiis...
or after the hepthemimer sometimes,

ibid. 19. Ut gaudet insitivam decerpens pyra.

And here comes in the curious question of accentual ca-
donce.
