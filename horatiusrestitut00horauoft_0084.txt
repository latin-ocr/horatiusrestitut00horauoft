l S. x. 40-«45. Arg-uta meretrice potes, Davoque Chremeta, ,
Eludente senem, comis garrire libellos 7
Unus vivorum, Fundaniz Pollio reguni ‚ ’
Facta canit, pede ter percusso: forte epos acer,
Ut nemo, Varius ducit: molle atque facetum
Virgilio annuerunt gaudentes rure Camoenoe.

The comic author Fundanius we meet again, (2 S. v111. Ῐ9,)
as the pleasant narrator of what happened at Nasidienus's
dinner. Varius, whose fine tragedy of Thyestes is so highly
praised by Quintilian, appears already to have been cele-
brated for that epic talent alluded to in 1 C. vn,

Scriberis Vario {ortis et hostium
Victor, Maeonio carminis aliti3 &c-

aud Pollio had acquired eminence in the tragic drama,
which we find him still maintaining when afterwards engaged
in the history of the civil wars ς

2 C. 1. 9—12. Paulum severae Musa Tragoediae
Desit theatris ς mox, ubi publicas
Res ordinaris, grande munus
Cecropio repetes cothurno.

while in regard *to Virgil the clear information is gained,
‘that he was then only known as ¹the writer· of Bucofids, 'but
in the delicacy 'and high finish of his style, (molle vatque
facetum) even then indicating the consummate poet that

was soon to arise.
And here from the same satire not unaptly <may be intro-
duced the proud list of all Horace's friends at that early

day.
vv. 81— 88. Plotius, et Varius, Maecenas, virgiliusque,
· ο Valgius, et probet haec Octavius optimus, atque
Fuscus ς et haec utinam Viscorum laudet uterque =
Ambitione relegata, te dicere possum,
Pollio, te, Messala, tuo oum fratre3 simulque
Vos, Bibule et Servi ; simul his te, candide Furni ε
Complures alios, doctos ego quos et amicos
Prudens praetereo, &c. διο. v

Well then mig'ht' Horace, when allowing in ot'her respects‘
