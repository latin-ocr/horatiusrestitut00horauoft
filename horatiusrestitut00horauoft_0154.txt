(130) APPENnix v.

gentlemen and men of letters, such as AElius Lamia, Arias
tius Fuscus, Julius Florus, Pompeius Varus, Quintilius,
Numicius, &c- Several of the last description, especiallyg
if they occur as repeatedly addressed or more than once
mentioned, may now commodiously, in the writinga of
Horace chronologically arranged, be viewed according to
the natural order in which the circumstances personally
concerning them are presented to the eye of the reader-
Under this head something has been already done in the,
Preface, for the names of Grosphus, Iccius, Quintius Hit-
pinus, and Septimius: nor could the literary friends of Ho-
race (P. D. 59, 60) as such be overlooked. Very much, after
all, must still be left to the taste of each individua] reader,
and to the inclination which he feels for matters of such pecu-
liar research. One question of this kind relating to Septimius
may not unaptly be discussed here. If on the authority of
the Commentator Vetus, as exhibited by Cruquius, we are to
consider Titius (1 E. 111. 9.) and Septimius, (1x. 1.) as
names of the same person3 then it seems to follow, that the ⁸
Epistles 111, v111, and lx, do not now stand in the same order
of time in which they were originally written, that is, the
rxth, which recommends Septimius to the favour of Tiberius
Claudius Nero, must have preceded the md, in which
Titius is spoken of as already in the suite of that young
Prince: and not improbably it was by the hands of Sep..
timius when he carried that introduction, that the vnlth
Epistle also was conveyed to Celsus Albinovanus, then one
. of the party. Taken in this succession, these three Epistles
may perhaps be better understood and more agreeably

perused.

On Agrippa, however, and Sallustius the younger, and
Nasidienus Rufus and the Pisos, some short remarks may
clearly be permitted‚ from the relation which· they bear to
Horace in one aspect or another.
