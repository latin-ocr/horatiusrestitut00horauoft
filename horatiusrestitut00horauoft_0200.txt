4 C. 11. 9. Laurea Ι donandus Ι Apollinari.

The relative position of its aceents remains to be eon-
sidered: and the cadence of the Sapphic is regulated in the
form A, by being accented on the 6th syllable, or on the
4th and 8th.

Grandinis misit P5ter, et rubente
Dextera sacras jaculfitus arces . . .

In the occasional varieties of form under B and C, the
accent is admitted on the 5th and 7th, or on the 5th and
8th:

B. Mercuri, facunde, nepos Atlantis . . .

C. Concines maj6re Poeta plectro.

which modes of accentuation are compatible with a disylla-
bic beginning as well as with the trisyllabic just given.

B. Fervet, immensusque rfiit profundo . . .

C. Lenis Ilithyia‚ tuere matres.

With all this diversity of forms in the verse, under such
limitations as structure and accent so combined will permit,
modern writers of the Sapphic Ode have not been content;
or rather they have not been acquainted with it. Amongst in-
stances in abundance from the revival of letters to the pre-
sent day, the following out of the Musoe Etonenses may
serve for sufficient illustration of scansion correct and struc-
ture violated.

Vol. 1. p. 28. v. 1. Pertinax Ι et luxurians juventa . . .

 

p. 159. v. 25. Hortuli dat Ι primitias aprici. · -

Verses like these admit of no defence even from the authority
of Catullus, who wrote the Sapphic stanza in all its Greek

freedom, as yet unchecked by the severer genius of the
⁴Latin: for even the following lines,

11. 6. 23. Seu Sacas 1 sagittiferosque Ι Parthos.
Ultimi flos Ι praetereunte Ι postquam . . .
