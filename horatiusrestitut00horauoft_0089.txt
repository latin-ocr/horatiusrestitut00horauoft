of the Sabine estate, we find him forming grand resolutione
as a kind of censor and moralist.

2 S. 111. 9. Atqui vultus erat multa et praeclara minantis.

He had this-year retired on the Saturnalia (v. 5) into the
country for leisure and for warmth.

v. lt). Si vamcum tepido cepisset villula tecto.

The latter charm we know the country possessed.

l E. x. 15. Est ubi plus tepeant hyemes?

If it be asked what were the causes of that advantage, the
Cato Major ξ xvr. may be consulted for explanation: Ubi
enim potest illa aetas aut calescere vel apricatione melius vel
igni, aut vicissim umbris aquisve refrigerari salubrius ?—-the
command of a sunny position on the one hand, and the
plenty of fuel on the other. And it may be remembered that
in that famous Epistle (xxv.) on the Sabine farm, Horace
tells his Villio-us that the Calo in the city envied him
amongst other things (vv. 41, 2.) the ready supply of logs;
which at Rome they had not.

invidet usum
Liymrum et pecoris tibi calo argutus et horti.

 

Horace (who reports himself [1 E. xx. 24] solibus aptum)
when more advanced in years, loved to pass his winters on
the sea-coast.

Thus in that fine Epistle to Maecenas, 1 Ε. νη. 10-13,

Quod si bruma nives Albanis illinet agris,

Ad mare descendet vates tuus, et sibi parcet,
Contractusque leget ς te, dulcis amice, reviset
Cum Zephyris, si concedes, et hirundine prima.

Incidentally we gather from another Epissse, that to

Scoeva, (xvn. 52, 3,) that Brundusium and Surrentum also
vere seenes of resort in winter ;

Brundisium comes aut Surrentum duetus namnum,
Q queritur salebras et aoerbumsn‘yus et imm, &c-
