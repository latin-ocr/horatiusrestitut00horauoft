acts ignorantly on this behalf, but he acts grossly wrong
also: for those Odes marked with the faulty structure he
has scattered promiscuously over the later books in his
arrangement and over the earlier, very much alike. No
difference is known; no discrimination is preserved. Need
one say more? And here with these proofs of his ,ἐπᾶρ-
ment disabled, let us take our leave of Mr. Sanadon for
the present.

The strange and accumulated mistakes in which the
personal history of Horace has been long involved, it would
be an irksome task to discuss one by one in detail. The
most important of them, however, shall be duly noticed in
the course of these pages3 and the whole mass will be put
into a way for ultimate clearance. It may be too much to
assert that the publication of the books of Horace in the
original series of succession will at once set all other things
right ε yet there can be no doubt, but the wrong, unnatural,
confused order, in which his works have hitherto been ex-
hibited, has given rise to a great portion of all the errors
existing at this day. And so long as the common arrange-
ment shall continue to influence the train of thought by the
order of perusal, it will be difficult if not impossible to over-
come that proneness to false combinations, which the work-
ing on a distorted view must of necessity create.

But when once that disorder is banished and the natural
succession restored, then the mind, instead of being misguided
by the mechanical progress of the hand and the eye, will be
by that progress directed and sustained all along in tracing
the personal and poetica] history of Horace. All the stages
of his career will then develope themselves in beautiful
transiti'on : especially, the Parian Iambics of the Sabine
Poet will precede as they ought, the Sapphic and Alcaic
stanzas of the Lyrist of Timli. ’
