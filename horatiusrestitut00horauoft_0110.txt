Horace in B. c. 25. at the latest, seems to refer to the great
and memorable submission from the East as already ac-
quired: and if it be so taken, that date of the Ode cannot

History with correct simplicity assures us (F. H. p. 238.)
that in B. c. 23. Tiridates being then at Rome, on an em-
bassy arriving from Phraates, Augustus seized the occasion,
