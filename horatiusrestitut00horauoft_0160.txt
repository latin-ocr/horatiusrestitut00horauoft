Perhaps a more striking example of the success with which
a writer in one of his works may be brought to illustrate him-
self in another, cannot be adduced, than the contrast betwixt
Horacc's fine address in recommending the good poets of his
own age to imperial favour <2 E. 1. ad Anqust. especially vv.
118—138.), and his bold way in exposing the bad or doubt-
ful poet to interminable ridicule, at the close of his personal
Epistle to the Pisos. This consideration, as showing the
totally different objects which Horace had in view, might
alone have sufficed to demonstrate what the poem so long
miscalled Ars Poetica should really be esteemed. ’

The services of Wieland, as an expositor of Horace, if at

German. Horace's literary and critica] writi-ngs, some of
the Satires in particular, require all the advantage that can
bc given, of full and luminous dissertation: and I cannot
lose thc opportunity, here presented or sought, to suggest,
that a judicious selection from Wieland, well translated by
an Horatian Scholar, would confer an inestimable benerit
wherevcr the study of Horace is liberally prosecuted in the
schools and Collegcs of this country.

It has been said in a former page (P. D. 70) that Horace
was “too shy or too proud for public recitation and the
common modes of courting popularity.”

The matters there alluded to, on Horace's account, may
deser-ve more particular developement; and if any apology
be needed for giving a brief notice of them in this place, let
