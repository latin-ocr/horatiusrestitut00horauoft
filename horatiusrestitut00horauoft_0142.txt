the two last, and that alone, the dread of popular insurrec-
ti0n‚ is specifically developed. ⁴ Ι

In the passage which itis our object here to elucidate,
there are three different characters proposed who are not to
be tempted from their respective attachments, the proud
candidate for public honourS, the already rich importer at
home of corn from Libya, and the contented yeoman

Paterna rura bobus exercens suis.

The splendid prize of temptation offered to each is wealtb
‘⁶‘ beyond the dreams of avarice,'' but only to be won by his
becoming a nauta, i. e. the adventurous mercator on the
dangerous main. And here evidently enough, abhorrence
at that offer, clogged with such a condition, would most na-
turally strike the third character described; being hardly
attributable in the same degree to either of the preceding
parties, since, to gain ulterior ends of ambition or opulence‚
even they might possibly be allured by so magnificent a
prospect.

When the passage is once placed in this clear and satisfac-
tory light, it seems quite wonderful how the true interpreta-
tion, which turns on Gaudentem, <as old at least as the time
of Glareanus,) could ever have been so strangely missed, and
modes to evade it, by otherwise interpreting the earlier part
of the Ode, with such perverse ingenuity devised. .

ΙΙ. The true reading at V. 29. of ΤΕ doctarum . . . on ne-
cessity arising from internal evidence, against ME a'nd the
MSS, after'the assent of scholars generally given, may now
take its place as it were by acclamation. The following brief
hints in favour of it, being partly novel also, may not be
unacceptable.

1. To the interrogation of J. J oneS, who edited Horace
in 1736. ‘⁴ Si jam Diis mistus esset superis Horatius, cur

‘se Maecenatis suffragio cohonestari cuperet ?'’ nothIng like a
sufficient answer ever has been or can be given.
