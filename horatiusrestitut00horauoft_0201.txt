evidently afford a'different certainly, ‘if not a more> plexasing,

structure· .
. -If, sshowever, in the versification of modern scholars we

have to condemn unliccnsed deviations from the models of
Horace, we shall find in the formal practice of those early
Poeta v‘vho came after him, something more remarkable in

‚the opposite direction.
'In Statius, for example, and in Prudentius, we remark a

’ decided predilection for thc structure (A) so denoted here,

with the cadence of accent on the 6th syllable, or of that
required, on the 4th and the 8th.

· The‘Sapphics of Statius, 4Silv. v11., from his affection
for the one caesura after the 5th syllable and its concomi-

aster the rich varieties of Horace3 while Prudentius at so
,uiuch later a period exhibits the same preference for un-
varied harmony, giving indeed a much stronger proof of it
in one Sapphic Poem of 200 lines without a single deviation
froin the structure alluded to. That Hymn, in honour of
thesseigh‘teen Martyrs, presentS, on the other hand, the two
following examples :

v. 57. Sola in occursum Ι numerosi6res . . .

v. 195. Spes ut absolvam Ι retinaculorum . . .

which cannot be said to have the requisite character, the
6th syllable accented; unless polysyllabic words of that
dimension (which seems not improbable) had then got an
accent on their lst syllable as well as on their 5th.

An observation arises here, so important if connected
with* the chronology of Horace's books as originally pub-
lished, that the reader will *hardly fail to take some interest
in the* detail which follows.

In the first and second books of the Odes, that peculiar
