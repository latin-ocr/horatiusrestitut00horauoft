Let us now proceed to the vnth Safire, Proscripti Reqz's
Rupili, δια, which might be supposed (and not without
some plausibility) to have been. Horace's earliest attempt in
Satiric writing, having the scene of its story at Clazomenae,
aud in the presence of the great-Brutus. In that view 'Mt
Sanadon speciously enough assigns for its date a few months
before the battle of Philippi, and even discovers, in its juve-
nile carelessness of composition, an argument to favour that
date.

The old Scholiast, however, quoted by Baxter, appears to
give a different, and, as I understand it, a very satisfactory
account of the matter.

Publius Rupilius cognomine Rex, Praenestinus, commilito
fuit Horatii in castris Bruti. Hic aegre ferens quod Hora-
tius Tribunus esset, saepe ignobilitatem generis illi obji-
ciebat: idcirco nunc eum ex persona alterius lacerat.

from two remarks of the judicious Gesner.

Forte haec demum post victoriam Caesarianorum scripta,
cum partes Bruti objiceret Horatio recepto, receptus ipse
Rupilius: ut Tubero olim Ligario.—Rem non plane re-
centem commendati versibus, ipsum exordium declarat.

And on Gesner's supposition that Rupilius had thus given
offence to Horace at Rome, after they both returned, the
th Satire, viewed as a retaliation, will be found not un-
happily subjoined as a kind of appendix to the vith, Non
quia Maecenas, δῖα, which resents (vv. 6-45.) the ill-a
