you have any better, order it to my house: [arcesse-ad
me. Vet. Schol.] or be content with what I offer you.”

” With Vix-gil again we shall find him playfully bargaining
to produce a finer and costlier wine on condition of his friend's
bringing to the dinner a richer perfume. (The costliness
of ungueuts iu that age may be estimated by their being one
of the common causes of tuin to the vain and the gay.

ι , Qui nuncvSulpiciis accubat horreis.

»Catullus on the contrary (xn1. Coenabis bene, mi Fa-
bulle, apud me) offers the very choicest perfume to F abul-
lus, if he will. bring the materials of a good dinner along
with him. .

. Another variety of good fellowship is presented to us in
that Ode 3 C. xrx. Quantum distet· ab Inacho . . . where
the Poet incidentally gives the principal requisites of a
dinnenfor which the richest wine was to be purchased at t-he
common expense‚.Quo Chium pretio cadum lvMercemur:
what friend'shouse was= to have the preference, Quo prae-
bute domum3 and as it was a day in winter, the provision
of a warm room against an assigned hour, Qutofi l Pelignis
caream frigoribus; form other points of consideration. The
words, Quis aquam temperet ignibus, in such a context can
bear but one meaning, that on a wintry day they would
naturally mingle hot water with their wine. The ‘⁶ calidae
gelidaeque minister” of Juvenal (S. v. 63.) would have had
but half his province on a day like that in the‘very depth of
winter.

> The 7th line of the Epistle Jamdudum forcibly reminds
one of the Ode to Maecenas, (3 C. xx1x.) by that expressive
word, but still more by contrast in the preparation there
made by the Poet to receive his patron.
