that would demand a volume for itself„ But in the chi-o,
nological table subjoined to these pages, it is hoped 'that
any historical knowledge directly required for the illustra-
tion of Horace, whenever clear intelligence can be had,
will seldom be found wanting. ’

In the meanwhile, however, with a more critical view
to the Tempora Horatiana of Bentley, it will be exceed-
ingly necessary to keep in mind, that the years which
he has determined for the composition of the several books
of Horace, in his own naked statement are liable to many
cavils, against which he has left neither caution nor vde-
fence. He should have told us, for instance, that in drawing
up that calculation he kept his eye principally or entirely
on inter-nal marks of public history, while to dates connected,
with the life or death of individuals, however distinguished,
he (apparently) paid little regard, and in short that all
which he engaged to do, was to fix the earliest and latest
allusion of an laistomal kind which could be discovered
in the book of Horace then before him. All this (but no
more than this) he executed well and faithfully. Let us
understand, therefore, what his intention exactly was: it
was a negative rather than a positive determination in the
dates which he ascertained.

Thus when he leaves an interval of three years betwixt
xxvl11 for the first book of Satires and xxx1 for the second ;
he never could intend to say, that during those three years
Horace's pen lay entirely idle: he meant (and he could
mean nothing else) that the very latest historical intimation
which he had been able to discover in the first book, did not

fall lower down than xxvn1 of Horace's age, and that the ’

very earliest intimation of any public event contained in
‘the second book did not rise higher than xxm of that cal-

culation-
With this important qualification constantly attached to

all the intervals apparent in Bentley's Tempora Horatiana,
