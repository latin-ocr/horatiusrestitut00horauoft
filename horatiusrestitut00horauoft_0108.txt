Now as Bentley's allowance of time for the first andr-second
books of Odes runs, down as low ,as B. c. 25. the disagreq- ο
ment in this solitary example might not be valid (ormight
not “be pleaded) against his chronology. ,

¹ But it is far more candid and ingenuous at once to con-
fess, that where any difficulties, created by the details· of
bioyraplty, depend on the authority of Hieronymus alone,
I am rather reluctant to submit; partly, because the author
of the Fasti Hellenici has himself in cases of that kind‘de·
tected >several inaccuracies; and partly on a more general
ground of reasonable doubt. Mistakes in the dates of birth
or death, ὅτε. in a distant age, where private persons are
concerned, may well be expected and excused3 because
without some public event or other to rest upon, such dates
must often float loose as it were for want os anchorage.

3. A remarkable instance of error in the biographical
dates of Hieronymus, occurs in his account of Lucilius the
Poet as born B. c. 148, and as dying in 103. With this
date of his birth two well attested facts are grossly at va·-
riance : the one on the authority of Velleius Paterculus,
11. 9, 4. “ Celebre et Lucilii nomen fuit qui sub P. Africano
Numantino bello eques militaverat‚” 13.c. 134. in which year
Lucilius, so dated, must have been a boy under age; and
the other, told by Horace of his personal friendship, when
already known as a bold Satirist, with the younger Scipio,
who died in B. c. 129.
