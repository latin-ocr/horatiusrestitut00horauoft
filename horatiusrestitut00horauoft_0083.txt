down to the year in which his patron gave him that estate
in the Sabine hills; the personal history of Horace must be

traced in the first book of Satires. The composition of that ’

book evidently belongs to the years fixed by Bentley, and.
probably enough to a year or two lower down.

Two Satires alone (the vth and vuth) in the number of
those ten seem to require any particular notice, from politi-
cal connection with the times to which, by the subjects of
them, the reader's mind is naturally carried.

The journey to Brundusium (Sat. V.) when determined
to the right year in the spring² of B. c. 38. will receive the
only further illustration which it cau admit or require, from
the history of the Commonwealth, to which it belongs, or

stom Mr. Cramer's Description of Ancient Italy. The most

beautiful passage in that poem shows how rapid and deep
the growth of affection had been betwixt Horace and his
two friends, virgil and Varius: of Plotius we know little
but by name.

vv. 39-44. Postera lux oritur multo gratissima: namque
¹ Plotius et Varius Sinuessae, Viryiliusqvae
Occurrunt3 animae, quales neque candidiores
Terra tulit, neque quis me sit devinctior alter.
Ο qui complexus, et gaudia quanta fuerunt !
Nil ego contulerim jucundo sanus amico.

that period embraces in fact so many of his personal friends 3

to the intended conference at Brundusium described by Appiam Civ. v. 78.
And you will obser-ve that this date, the spring of υ. c. 716, Β. c. 38, for
the poet's journey, will bring that vth Satire of the lst Book within the
dates of Bentley.'‘ H. F. Clinton. MS. communicativa.
