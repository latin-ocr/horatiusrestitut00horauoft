(170) on Tm: METRES or HORAcE.

Mmmz x1. 2 C. xvm. ' (1) Trochaic of seven syllables.
(2) Iambic trimeter wanting a syllable, as in M. v111. (2).

(l) Non ebur neque aureum
(2) Mea renidet Ι in domo lacunar.

Verse (1) has its scansion thus,

μ -υ -υ -υῦ

Χ without any thing to remark in its structure.

Verse (2) in scansion differs from its model above referred
to only once.

v. 34. Regumque pueris nec satelles Orci,

where the tribrach (νυν) in 2⁰¹0, if that deserves notice,

might be avoided, and on some authority, by reading Re-
gumque natis. . instead.

METRE x11. 3 C. x11. Ionic a minore (νυ --).

Miserarum est Ι nec amori Ι dare ludum Ι neque dulci,

according to Dr. Bentley, (by whose critical erudition here
also the reader may benefit‚) consists of four Stanzas, each of
ten feet, agreeably to the following scheme :

υν--ι uv-— υυ-ι- htv—-
UU-— υἱέ-υ· υἱέ-ι·- UH--

υν-- υυ--

The caesura betwixt the several feet (as in vv.. 5, 7, 8, 12')
is not strictly observed; though by the above distribution
all awkward'ness is avoided betwixt one line and another.

· Cas. Sarbievius‚ adopting this metre in one of his com-
positions‚ 2 Lyric. xxvln„ has made the stanza consist of
two trimeters and one tetrameter ; and violates the synaphea
'or continuity of scansion betwixt line and line, (vvJ 5, 6, 9,
10,) which in Horace from first to last is observed.
