having the short syllable final prolonged in arsi of dactylie
verse 3 or, like the one rare example,

2 C. Vl. 13, 14. Ille terrarum mihi praeter omnes
Angulus ridet, ubi non Hymetto. . . .

having the same prolongation in arsi where that part of the
verse is dactylic.

ΙΙΙ. Νοι· again, may the nice collocation of words be
neglected.

The elder Scaliger, with that pride and dogmatism¹ and
partiality so strong in his character, laying down a principle
which no doubt has often been verified,

Epitheta quae in fine versuum existunt, soepe esse argu-
mento coactae locutionis, quasi sint carminis supplementa. . .
upon that ground applies his hypercritical censure to this
faultless line,

3 C. xxrx. 20. Sole dies referente siccos.

When Sol brings round the days—-what days ?—those of
thirst.

In number ΙΙ. of Quaestiones Venusinae (J. Τ.) which
Sylvanus Urban has admitted in his pageS, (Gent. Mag.
April, 1834‚) there appears the Plea of Horace the Poet
against Scaliger the Critic; and the task of vindication
there performed I certainly may consider as complete and
satisfactory .

Where the vis or essence lies in the attribute, the Latin
poets frequently subjoin it to the noun, and for greater em-
phasis terminate the verse with it. He who runs, may read
thi's in the practice of Virgil; twice for instance, in the course
of eleven lines, AEn. vnn-662, 672, and elsewhere as often
asfrom other causes it could be expected to occur.

Consistently with this remark, let me add, thc text of
Horace, A. P. 36, 7, ought here to have been correctly
exhibited, on Bentley's emendation . . . .
