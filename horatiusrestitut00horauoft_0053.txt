LOCALITIES. (29)

neem to have used his pen at all: contractusque ἱερεῖ, are
his own words, 1 E. vu. 12, when meditating to go down
to the sea, most probably to Baiae.

Let me not be considered as dwelling too long on this
investigation of the Poet's principal localities. Or should
it be asked, in what way those points when determined‚ can
give aid towards the illustration of Horace, the following
examples with the deductions arising out of them may serve
at present for a reply.

(1.) For the entire separation of Horace's residence in
the Sabine valley, not only from his house at Rome, but
from his humble mansion at Tivoli, we are very much in-
debted to the‘information conveyed in his x1vth Epistle.

As the picture of country life in all its simplicity and in-
nocence which the 2d Epode (Beatus ille, ᾃσ.) presents‚ was
in its general character drawn from Horace's personal know-
ledge and observation in the vale of Licenza; so we may
with the greater zest enjoy the moral repas-e in those of his
writings which bear the stamp of that valley, as the subject
at once and the scene of composition.

Now that Epistle (the x1vth) to his Villio-us, besides
much that it tells us not otherwise known of Horace in
Romi: suo and of his employments there, most fortunately

tells us also, from what pests or pleasures that abode of
Sabine virtue was free.
