alleges, promiscuously written and then published together
all at once.

Nor‘is an immediate answer wanting to meet that one
allegation (at least) under the fourth head, that Bentley is
wrong in allowing to Horace (as he appears to do) intervals
of idleness'betwixt one set of books and another. As to that
subject ‘of mere over-sight or omission on the part of Bentley,
satisfactory explanation has been already afforded in P. D.
p. 82.

The most ingenious and plausible perhaps of all Kirch-
ner's conjectures is that which he has started under his
Qums'r1o(1v²⁸)p.54. De Itinere Brundusino. Horace,
he suggestS‚ at p. 60, might have taken that opportunity to
go on from Brundusium to Tarentum: when there, he might
have written that Satire itself‚ 1 S. v, Egressum magnei . . ,
from thence he might have returned to Rome by the direct
way through Venusia: when at his native spot, he might
have addressed that Ode to the Fons Bandusinus, 3 C. xum
and having at the same time renewed his friendship with the
worthy old man Ofellus, he might on his return home have
composed the beautiful Satire, 2 S. 11. Quae virtus .....
And besides all this, for some reason or other, he might in
that year have written the Epode x1. Petti, nihil me . . . .-
aud the dialogue with Archytas too, 1 C. xxv111. Te maris
et terroe . . . .--“ why so?'' if you ask: Tarentum (v. 29) is
certainly mentioned in it.

In this complex scheme, built on a series of assumptions,
even that part which regards the visit to Ofellus, though it
carries an air of probalfility with it, is by no means wanted to
account for Horace's actual acquaintance with those facts:
