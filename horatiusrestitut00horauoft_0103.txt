of sacrifice, go a step farther still ? May we not'pronounce
that even in that dark state of all true theology, Horace
had the grateful feeling of religion, however obscurely as to
the objecta of it, and that he was right in the subjective
gratitude, though he was wrong in the objective devotion?

The connection, from causes curious and rare, of Mae-
‘cenas's name with the town of Tivoli, has been auspicious
to the developement of' Horace's principal locality in that
romantio spot. For not only has that admirable Ode,
3 C. xxm. ¹Tmo-hena reyum. . . .aff0rded subject almost for
demonstration, that Horace invited Maecenas to dine at
Tivoli: but that beautiful and from its allusion, pathetic
Ode, 1 C. xx. Vile potabi8‚ &a according to an old tradi-
tion recorded by the commentator in Cruquius, and credited
by Torrentius, was occasioned by a journey of Maecenas into
Apulia.

Maecenas iturus in Apuliam, significavit Horatio, ei se
ante profectionem convivam esse velle: cui respondet Hora-
tius, se quidem non habere vinum generosum, sed benigno
tamen animo ei exhibiturum vinum quod habebat Sabinum.
De profectione in Apuliam mentio fit in Divaei codice.

On the supposition of such a Journey, is it at all credible,
that the prime minister would ask Horace to give him a
dinner at Rome before he set out? Is it not far more
natural to conceive, that Maecenas had told his friend to
expect him at Tivoli to dinner, as he would pass by the
Via Valeria, (Cramer. Ι. 142. 11. 260‚) and that Horace on
such a hint, really having a cask of Sabine wine there with
so delightful a remembrance attached to it,

 

datus in theatro Ι cum tibi plausus, &c-

wrote in reply the delicate and well turned invitation in that
Sapphic Ode?
