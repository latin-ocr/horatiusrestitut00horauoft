No ear could confound the verse of Horace with that of
Casimir.

The Christian Poet, PRUDEN'rms, (circ. 400 mn.) has
constructed a system of his own out of the third, second,
and first (in that order) of these interposed Choriambics; for
which, in the nomenclature sometimes applied to Horace's
Odes‚ the name would stand thus:

τρίκωλος τρίστροφος,

denoting that there are three kinds of verse, and then that
three lines form the strophe or stanza.

The following specimen is taken from the Prooemium to
his Carmina, and only by one blemish at v. 6. discovers
any incorrectness in the composition.

Per quinquennia jam decem,
Ni fallor, fuimus ε septimus insuper
Annum cardo rotat, dum fruimur sole volubili.
Instat terminus, et diem
Vicinum senio jam Deus applicat ε
Quid nos utile tan Ι ti spatio temporis egimus Ρ
AEtas prima crepantibus

Flevit sub ferulis ι mox docuit toga
Infectum vitiis salsa loqui, non sine crimine. ,

Let me take this opportunity, in the words of Dr. Herbert,
to call the attention of scholars to the splendid passage at
the end of Prudentius contra Symmachum, concerning the
vestal virgins: it begins,

v. 1069. Captivus pudor ingratis addicitur aris,

and is inferior to nothing of the same kind in Juvenal.
