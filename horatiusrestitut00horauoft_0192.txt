METRE vu. EronE xv11. Iambic trimeter as M.'1.
(l), and that alone.

Jamjam efficaci do manus scientiae.

Mna-RES vm. ‘ro ΧΠ.

Now of the Metres hardly to be called lyrical.

ΜΕΤιιΕ v111. 1 C. ιν. (1) Dactylic tetrameter -Ι- three
Trochees, with (2) Iambic trimeter wanting a syllable at the

close.

(1) Solvitur acris hiems grata vice Ι veris et Favoni,
(2) 'trahuntque siccas Ι machinae carinas.

The verse (1) has this scansion, differing in the 4th foot
from Metre 111. (2).

-υν —uu -υυ —uu -υ ..υ ..g

and the divisio vocum is constantly observed betwixt the
Dactylic part and the Trochaic.

The verse (2) in fact consists of two parts, which, hav-
ing the divisio vocum constantly, may be scanned according
to the structure3 the one Iambic, and the other as in (1)
Trochaic.

υ- υ-- -υ -υ —2

Cas. Sarbievius when writing in this metre‚ violates the law
of caesura in (1).

2 Lyr. xx. 53. Nec quae dispositis toga luxuri Ι osior lapillis.
nor has he any authority from Horace for a line constructed

(as with ‘him it often is) with the Dactyl in 4‘0 formed by'
one word.

Ibid. v. 1. Qualis ubi Phrygia Jovis Ι armiger ΙΙ educatus Ida.
