of its having been devoted by Horace as the ultimate offer-
ing of his muse. And in that respect, so far as regarded
the Patron, the Poet never altered his purpose. Whatever
he afterwards wrote, is left to stand rseparately on its own
inscription and title, insulated as it were, and posthumoun to
the great body of his works ε which he certainly had medi-
tated to complete in the two books of Satires, the one of
Epodes, the three of Odes, and the one of Epistles.

Maecenas was Horace's only patron: and the Poet has
succeeded in leaving that recorded indelibly.

Even in regard of Augustus, it may sound :somewhat ex-
traordinary, and yet itis perfectly true, that in the common
meaning of that term he never was the patron of Horace.
Except in those words imputed to Suetonius, uncique et
alteret liberalitate locupletavit, there exists no evidence of
Horace having owed anything to the patronage of the Em-
peror. Virgil and Varius, beyond a doubt, were deeply in-
debted to that Prince's generosity. And Horace, who felt a
service done to a friend as a kindness conferred on himself,
has in that beautiful address to Augustus in favorem sui
temporis Poetarum, made the acknowledgement, to the
honour of all parties concerned.
