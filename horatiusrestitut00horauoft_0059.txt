LocAm'rlsss, (35)

Thu is, denying olive yards and vineyards to be the cause
of his frefflneae, he in fac't disclaims the owners-hip of
either: and he disclaims also any possession of what even
in the privileged hour of dedication he had declined to ask
from Apollo Palatinus

Non aestuosae grata Calabriae
Armenta. 1 C. xxxr. 5, 6.

The vale of Lioenm, let it be remaflced, appears at that
time to have· grown neither vines nor olives. Even nOW,
though the difference of culture, as ΜΓ. Bradstreet assures
us (pp. 25, 27.) has introduced a great number of olives,
ὅτε. the ἔταμες do not succeed so kindly, as the hardier
fruit trees, a'nd still produce but a rough kind of wine.
After this indirect determination of the extent of
Horace's weasth, it may not be amiss to render the state-
ment in some measure complete by noticing the lines, am-

, biguons certainly, which commencc the Epistle (xvl) to

Quinctius H irpinus.

Ne perconteris, fundus meus, optime Quinti,
Arvopascat herum, an baccis opulentet olim,
Pomisme, an pratis, an amicta vitibus ulmo ,-
Scribetur tibi forma loquaciter et situs agri.
Continui montes ‚- nisi dissocientur οραοᾶ

Valle.- sed ut veniens dextrum latus aspiciat Sol,
Laevum decedens curru fugiente vaporet.
Temperiem laudes: quid, si rubicunda benigne
Corruz vepres et prum ferunt ? si quercus et ilex
Multa smye pecus, mult& dominum juvat umbra 3
Dicas adductum propius frondere Tarentum.

From this passage, Μ. Chaupy, (Vol. 1. p. 335‚) in defi-
ance of Sanadon and the common interpreters, avowedly so,
maintains that Horace's estate was richly productive of
obices, grapes, and other fine fruits also. Now*‚ in good
truth‚ if from these lines (liable enough, perhaps, if taken
alone, to be misunderstood) we had to gain our only intelli-

gence on the subject, the contium· montes with th'e opacet
