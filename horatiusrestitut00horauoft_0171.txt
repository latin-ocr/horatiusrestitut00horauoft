arises little perhaps suspected by Kirchner, and for which
he will hardly, I sear, have any answer provided. ‹It is
this: with the exception of that Epistle, written one summer
(1 Ε. u. 2.) from cool Praeneste, and suggested by what he
had been recently reading there, Horace does not appear
stom any intimation extant, (Ι speak advisedly,) to have em-
ployed himself in writing any where, unless at his usual
ψ places of residence, Tivoli and the Sabine Villa in his later
days, Rome chiefly perhaps at an earlier period. At all
events, we are specifically told, that in his winter plan for
going *down to the sea, (to Baiae, generally,) he expected to

read, it is true,

1 Ε. vn. 11, 12. Ad mare descendet vates tuus, et sibi parcet,
Contractusqne ἱερεῖς

but not a word, be it remarked, of any thing in the shape of
poetica] composition is there mentioned. And if at any
season he had given way to the temptation of occasional
writing, admonitu locorum, is it probable, let me ask, that
not one trace should now remain of his Muse having been
on any spot occupied in any task of that nature ?

Finally, and to have done, it may afford something more
than amusement to observe, how the two principal anta-
gonists of our system, united only in rejecting it, differ toto
coelo from each other in the detail of what they would sub-
stitute: in fact, they have no common principle upon which
to proceed together, nor, as far as I can discover, has either
of them any distinct plan to guide his separate researches.

In noticing Dr. Kirchner therefore as the new Sanadon,
Ι had no design to insinuate that he follows the steps of
that lively and oracular critic. Quite the contrary indeed :

his course is far more eccentric than that of his predecessor;
