POSTSCRIPT ΤΟ THE METRES.

The boast of Horace,

3 C. xxx. 13, 14. Princeps AEolium carmen ad Italos
Deduxisse modos. . . .

that by happy change and adaptation he had transferred the

· metres of Sappho and Alcaeus into the uses of Latin poeti-y,

might require for its full justification a more detailed com--
parison betwixt his Lyric verses and the remaining frag-
ments of those poets, than need at present be attempted.
But for satisfaction generally on this head, the reader is
referred to Gaisford's Hephaestion, 1810, to Hermann's
Elementa Doctrinae Metricae‚ 1816, and to Chai-les Bur-
ney's article in the Monthly RevieW, u. s., who was the first
scholar to investigate the subject, in 1798.

In the Sapphic Stanza‚ the Greek preference so decided
of a short syllable in the 4th place where Horace always has
the lon-ch as well as numerous varieties of structure, which the
Romam fidicen lyrae could not or would not adopt, have
been sufficiently described elsewhere ἐκ, and are too well
known to require formality of demonstration. Catullus's
Sapphic verse also, in these pages already referred to, may
easilybe ¹consusted, (Odes XI, xnv111‚) to contrast his looser
and ruder movemcnt with the regulated cadences of Horace,
in that its state of perfection as a Latin mette.
