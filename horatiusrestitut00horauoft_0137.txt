on MAECENAS. ” (113)

cerity betwixt two stiends may be tested, we' have already
witnessed (P. D. 75.) an admirable proof3 where Horace re-
monstrates with Maecenas on his protracted absence in the
country having been made the subject of complaint. In the
following lines,

Ι Ε. 1. 94-105. Si curatus inaequ‘ali tonsore capillos
Oculi-ri, rides: si forte subucula pexae
Trita subest tunicae, vel si toga dissidet impar,
Rides. Quid, mea cum pugnat sententia secum 3³
Quod petiit, spernit; repetit quod nuper omisit ἶ)
AEstuat et vitae disconvenit ordine toto ἲ
Dii-uit, aedificat, mutat quadrata rotundis ,⁹
Insanire putas solennia me, neque rides,
Nec medici credis nec curatoris egere
A praetore dati ; rerum tutela mearum
Cum sis, et prave sectum stomacheris ob unguem
De te pendentis, te respicientis amici-

we discover a yet bolder tone of expostulation, but in—
volving at the close an acknowledgment of deep and cordial
devotedness which only such a benefactor by a long series
of kindness could have created3 while protestation like this
from Horace against Maecenas for inconsistency (somewhat
overcharged‚ perhaps) in showing such extreme nicety as to
the proprieties of his dress and so little solicitude as to the
prudence and sanity of his conduct, may well be recorded as
the result of a freedom accumulated during the intimacy of
many years.

With the advantage of such dispositions on the one side
and the other, no wonder that the relationship of the major
and the minor amicus proceeded so happily. And Horace,
who with excellent sense could instruct Scaeva and Lollius
(1 E. xvu. xvnr.) how to live with the great, avoiding
offence and maintaining respectability, would himself in the
Palace of Maecenas easily steer without a pilot.

But not only was the personal character of Maecenas in
this relation of the man of rank to the man of genius
