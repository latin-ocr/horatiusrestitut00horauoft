sippus aud Co., will be found perfectly compatible with the
calm allusion in his later Odes (e. g. 3 C. 11. 17-203 4 C.
lx, 39—44‚ διο.) to those moral energies of that high doc·
· trine, which Roman virtue alone might realize or approach.

From the same correctness of vieW, that topic of litera-
ture now lost, De Personis Horatianis, will yet derive con-
siderable illustration, especially as to some of his most va-
luablc friends. Thus, Septimius (2 C. vr.) who with an
honest cordiality invites Horace to live and die with him at
his adored Tarentum, is still recognised as the same worthy
man and equally beloved, when after a few years, weary of
retirement, hc turns adventurer, and gains that exquisite
letter of introduction (1 Ε. 1x.) to the young Prince Tibe-
rius, then in Asia.

Again, Iccius, whose pursuit of philosophy did not con-
ceal from Horace his hankering after wealth, sustains a sharp
but delicate chastisement (1 C. xxm.) at an early period:
some ten years afterwards (1 E. ΧΠ.) (when in Sicily as the
procurator of Agrippa) he receives an Epistle introductory
of Growhus, already settled there, (2 C. xvx. 33,) in which
the sweet is very ingeniously made to predominate over the
bitter‚ and to all appearance quite consistently with honesty
and truth.

It is to Horace's moral treatment of Iccius, and to other
cases like it perhaps, such as that of Quintius Hirpinus (2
C. xr ς 1 Ε. xvi. 17, διο.) and it may be to that of Virqil
also (4 C. x11. 15. 21, &c.); that his most devoted admirer,
Persius, seems to bear this happy and characteristic testi-
mony.

Omne vafer vitium ridenti Flaccus amieo
Tangit, et admissus circum praecordia ludit. - Sat. 1. 116, 7.

¹And yet—arch Horace, while he strove to mend,
Probed all the foibles of his smiling friend ;
Played lightly round and round the peccaut part,

And won, unroh, an entrance to his hear-t. G
