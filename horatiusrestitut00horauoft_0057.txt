and let the Ῐιάσ pinu be especially remarked, for the same
scene, apparently, as chat in the beautiful stanza, 2 C. 111.
9—12. Qua pinus, δῖα, rivo. ”
On the authority of Mr. Hobhouse (in his note 71 to Canto
lv, of Childe Harold) and from his own lively report we
learn, that the Pine is now as it was in the days of
virgil, a garden tree [pinus in hortis. Buc. v11. 65.]; and
that there is not'' at present, “ a Pine in the whole valley''
of Licenza. ' Ι venture to add, that not one verse of Horace
decisively records a single Pine in that valley3 and it is
barely possible, that in the course of the few years which
elapsed betwixt the 2d book of Satires and the 2d or 3d
book of Odes, any Pine treeof Horace's own planting there
should have been imminens villae (3 C. xxu. 5.) or as in
the Ode before us, like Virgil's plane trec», (Geo. lv, 146.)

. As for Quinctius Hirpinus in particular, it is quite clear,
,that he had never visited (what friend of Horace, does it
appear, ever did visit Ρ) the vale of Licenza: or we should
not have now possessed that Epistle (the xwth) with the
Poet'sbdescription of his deliyht (hae latebrae dulces) in the
Sabine valley, and of the romantic beauty (amoenae) which
adorned it. He did not rest his attachment to that seques-
tered spot, on the ground of a partiality merely resulting
from habitual residence, “cum locis etiam ipsis montuosis
delectemur et sylvestribus, (these are Cicero's words,) in
quibus diutius commorati sumus?5 Laelius. s. 19. For
such scenery of the pictur-esque kind he avows at once his
taste and admiration, in a way that ,fuae ¹should hardly expect,
writing thus to his Villicus, l Efxrv. 19, 20. on the con-

trast of their respective likings, l
