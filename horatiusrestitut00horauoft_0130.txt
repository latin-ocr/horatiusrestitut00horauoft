Martial‚ for instance, allusively represents the wife of ‘the'
great Curius in that early age,

VI. 64.

 

dum prandia portat aranti t

and to this traditional story of the luncheon we may fairly
subjoin Horace's contemporary account of the principal
meal or coena at the close of the day's work.

Ep. ιι. 39—48. Quod si pudica mulier. . .
Sacrum vetustis exstruat lignis focum

Lassi sub adventum viri.
s ιι ιι ..ι ιι

Et horna dulci vina promens dolio,
Dapes inemtas apparet; διο.

In Horace's age, it is here asserted, that the Romans
usually took no breakfast. Of such a point minuter ex-
amination for different periods may well be excused. From
the epigrams of Martial, however, while it appears, that for
general use he recommends the caseus Vestinus, (x111. 31,)
we also learn that boys rising at a very early hour had
that allowance in a cake or biscuit made for the purpose.

xw. 223. Surgite, jam vendit pueris jentacula pistor,
Cristataeque sonant undique lucis aves.

At the other end of the day, the genuine debauch of the
luxurious was not completed without a final carouse, which
also had its proper appellation; and in Suetonius's Life of'
Vitellius (ξ 13.) we are informed, that the imperial
goul-mand sometimes contrived to dispatch the whole four,
‘⁶ facile omnibus sufficiens vomitandi consuetudine,'' though
with him every meal was a feast. That quaternion and the
order of it, in a fictitious line to aid the memory, may thus
be expressed: ⁰

‹lentat-mum, dein prandium, post emnam comissatio.
