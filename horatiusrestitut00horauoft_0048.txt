on this Tivoline question, decisively in agreement with every
previous judgment and notion of my own. The learned

1779.’ Cap. iii.> par. 1. ξ 5. and in their Nuove Ricerche,
pag. 94. maintain the existence there of a Villa of Horace,
but consisting only in un tenue rural squiorno‘ in ‘em
Casino entro un Orto.

A modest rural abode, a Cottaqe within a qarden, there,
is preciselyJafter his house at Rome and his Villa in the
Sabine country, the one place needful to complete the'Poet's
list of accommodations3 equally needfuL let me add, to
render his writings, especially the Odes, intelligible and
consistent to an inquisitive reader.

My own mind unquestionably was first set a thinking on
the subject of his Tivoline residenee by that noble emenda·
tion of Nicholas Hardinge; which comes down to us recom-
mended by' Markland, approved by Bentley, and applauded
by Parr.

——Eripe te morae ;
U'r semper-udum Tibur et AEsulae
Declive contempleris arvum et
Telegoni juga parricidae. 3 C. xrux. 5—8.

That emendation itself I first saw in Markland's Explica-
tiones veterum aliquot auctorum (p. 258-267) subjoined
to his edition of the Supplices Mulieres: but having since
'read the suggested change in a Letter -from Nichth
Hardinge to a friend of his then making ‘the tour of Italy,
I prefer to'record it here in the very words of that 'Vir ca-
pitalis armenii, as he is justly styled by Markland 'in the
passage referred to.

in all the Editions and MSS?
