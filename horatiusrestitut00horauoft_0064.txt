(40) raEmmNARY DISSERTATION.

“ In sooth‚” almost from his cradle, young Horace “ was

⁴ no vulgar boy;’' if we may credit his own story, with the

interpretation of it by the neighbours atfached to circum-
stances of so surprising and delightful a nature.

In the spring therefore, B. c. 60. (in the spring, for it was
novdfronde) when Horace was a few months beyond his
fourth year complete, that danger and deliverance befel him
in his adventurous wanderings‚ which no pen should de-
scribe but his own.

3 C. 1v. 9—20. Me fabulosae Volture in Appulo,
Altricis extra limen Apuliae‚
Ludo fatigatumque somno,

Fronde nova puerum palumbes
Texere: mimm quod foret omnibus,
Quicumque celsae nidum Acherontiae‚

Saltusque Bantinos, et arvum

Pingue tenent humilis Ferenti ;
Ut tuto ab atris corpore viperis
Dor-mirem et ursis; ut premerer sacra

Lauroque, collataque myrto,

Non sine Dis animosus infans.

How beautifully after this follows, how triumphantly

indeed !
Vester, camoenae, vester in arduos

Tollor Sabinos; &c. &c-

An accident, which at a much later period of life befel him
in ayro Sabino, may yet without impropriety be noticed
here3 inasmuch as he gratefully attributes his protection
from that danger also to the favour of divine agency. The
event alluded -to produced at the time an ode, itself no mean
specimen of the triumph of poetry, (2 C. x111.) if we trace
the progress of fine reflection and splendid imagery from its

opening,
“ Ille et nefasto te posuit die,
to its close
Nec curat Orion leones, '

Aut timidos agitare lyncas.
