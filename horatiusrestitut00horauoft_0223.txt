S.Theb.295—301. ‘roi μὲν γὰρ ποτὶ πύργοις . , .

Philoct. 1124. πόντου θινὸς ἐφήμενος.

The light tripping delicacy, however, of Catullus's Stanza
with the fa'vorite Trochee initial, in all respects so very
beautiful, is a masterpiece of success, with all the difficulty
(cudentis speciem dabit, et torquebitur) of its inimitable
execution.

Torquatus volo parvulus
Matris e gremio suae
Porrigens teneras manus
Dulce rideat ad patrem
Semihiante labella-Manlius et Junia.

Nothing but the inconsiderate compliment paid by Dr.
Bentley, “Epigramma veteris grammatici in PASiPHAEN

sure of its most flagrant deviations from the model proposed.

v. 7. Optat in sormam bovis——

ξ has the long syllable in 4‘0, where Horace (Metre x1.)
always has it short.

Non ebur neque aureum.
