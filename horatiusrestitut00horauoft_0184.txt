(160) ox 'rme METRES oF nonAcn.

A precise enumeration of the different authors to whom
my obligations are due, and partly so in very recent per-usal,
even with some particularity‚ will be excused as an act of
justice, in this stage the more necessary; because, consist-
ently with any brevity of design‚ it will not be convenient
to acknowledge every item of such debt‚ where it separately
occurs.

1. The late Dr. Charles Burney, the vir doctissimus et
mihi lonyo amicitiae usu conjunctissimus of Professor
Porson, (ad. Med. 89,) in the Monthly Review, Jan. 1798,
Vol. xxv., as the author of a critique original at once and
elaborate on Samuel Butler's edition of Marcus Musurus,
prefixed to the publication of Greek and Latin Oetes, &c.‚
by that distinguished scholar, who since then has borne such
a splendid name as the master of Shrewsbury school.

2. The Hon. and Rev. Dr. William Herbert, partly as
the Editor of Musae Etonenses in 1795, with a short Pre-
face of critical remarks3 but far more extensively‚ as the
author of that article in the Edinburgh RevieW, (No. ΧΠ.
J uly, 1805, pp. 357—386‚) on Mitford’s Harmony of Lan-
9uaqe: in which not only is the claim of aceent brought
forward to share with quantity in the regulation and cadence
of Latin verse, but after a full demonstration of that point
a clue also is given to trace the gradual progress by which
accent superseded quantity in European metre. Let me
hereacknowledge the more recent and personal obligation
conferred in Dr. Herbert's correspondence with me, 'and in
the opportunity granted to benefit by the nice powers of
discrimination' which he possesses in so extraordinary a
degree.

3. The Editor of Musae Cantabriqienses‚ 1810, as hav-
ing contributed a neat conspectus of practical observations
on the structure of the third verse of the Alcaic stanza.

4. The celebrated Professor Hermann, as the author of ,

Elementa Doctrimc Metricae, Leipsig‚ 1816; Glasgow',
