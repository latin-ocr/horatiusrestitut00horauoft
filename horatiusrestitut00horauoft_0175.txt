Praecipuam curam duxit sensum animi quam apertissime
exprimere: quod quo facilius efficeret, -aut necubi lectorem
vel auditorem obturbaret ac moraretur, neque praepositiones
verbis addere neque conjunctiones saepius iterare dubitavit,
quae detractae afferunt aliquid obscuritatis, etsi gratiam
augent.

The parenthetic mark also, when critically interposed‚
may serve well to prevent confusion and mistake. The
following passage, awkward at the best, affords good illus-
tration of such a use ;

l S. lv. 69—74. Ut sis tu similis Coeli Birrique, latronum,

Non ego sim Capri neque Sulci3 (cur metuas me?)

Nulla taberna meos habeat neque pila libellos,

’ Queis manus insudet vulgi Hermogenisque Tigelli,

Nec recitem quidquam, nisi amicis, idque coactus

Non-ubivis, coramve quibuslibet.
Where unless the words . . cur metuas me? . . be kept se-
parate by a parenthesis, the continuity of the sense is en-
tirely lost. A rough translation will show it sufficiently.

Though you may resemble those highwaymen, Coelius
and Birrius, it does not follow that I am to be like Caprius
or Sulcius, the informers, (why need you then be afraid of
me ?) nor that any shop should have my writings for sale, nor
yet that Ι should make a common practice of rehearsing,
δια, &c.

Here, be it remarked, the old commentator in Cruquius
seems* to have rightly apprehended the difficulty of thc
passage, as it usually stands, which hc would rectify by
supplying cum before v, 71. [Cum] nulla taberna, &a
With cum, sure enough, every thing would run on per-
spicuously and well: but then cum is not there, and it
cannot on any pretence be understood.

Nor is the mark here occasionally set on the ά final with-
out its adrantage, to show the true reading3 especially where
a change in the text has taken place, as l Sat. 1x. 29, 30.

Sabella Ι Quod puero cecinit moed divina anus armi.
