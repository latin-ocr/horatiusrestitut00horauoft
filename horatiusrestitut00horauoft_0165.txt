Poemntum suorum Libros scripsit, constitutione: and to the
system laid down by Dr. Bentley, he is on four different
heads decidedly opposed.

Bentley is wrong, he alleges, in asserting (l .) that Horace
at one and the same time devoted his pen only to one species
of composition, and (2.) that Horace did not give publica-
tion to separate pieces, but only to whole books at a time.

Bentley is wrong also in asserting (3.), that Horace pub—
lished the books separately one by one, and not more than
one together.

Bentley is farther wrong in determining (4.) the years
within which the several volumes were composed.

Under the first of these heads, let me be allowed to show
a specimen of Kirchner's proposed arrangement.

In the year B. c. 28. and of Horace 37. Kirclmer fixes his
date for the following pieces, for instance, amongst others,
2 S. 1. Sunt quibus in Satira. . . 1 C. xxm. Quid dedica-
tum . . . 2 C. xv. Jam pauca aratro . . . and 3 C. vr. Delicta
majorwm . . . .

It is on the suggestions of a fanciful and capricious inge-
nuity‚ that Kirchner, like a new Sanadon‚ has perpetrated
this strange divulsion of wholes from wholes, and a conjunc-
tion as strange of pieces with pieces tied obtorto collo together.
The very sight of his Tabula chronologica Horatiana is
quite enough to astonish and offend by the presumption with
which every single piece has, its separate year precisely
affixed to it, and by the boldness with which all the pieces
are dissevered from that connection within the same book,
which had remained undisturbed for seventeen centuries.

Luckily‚ on the one hand, internal evidence, derived from
comparing the Alcaic metre in different books, affords an
argument which cannot well be eluded: and as if to stumble
at that block‚ Kirchner does not hesitate to declare, that all
the Odes of the first, second, and third books were promis-
cuously written and then published collectively at once in Β. c.
