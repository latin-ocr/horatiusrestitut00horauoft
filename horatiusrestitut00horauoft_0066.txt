l S. vr. 71 -76, Causa fuit pater hist qui macro pauper agello
Noluit in Flavi ludum me mittere ς magni
Quo pueri magnis e centurionibus orti,
Laevo suspensi loculos tabulamque lacerto,
Ibant octonis referentes Idibus aeraz
Sed puerum est ausus Romam portare, διο.

Horace at the time of their migration, Ι think, could hardly
be less than twelve years old. That age will agree well
enough with the term, mihi parvo, which chronicles the
stripes of Orbilius (2 E. 1. 70.); and an earlier date, Ι fear,
will hardly allow sufficient age for many points of observ-
ation on life and manners, picked up by the boy Horace be-
fore quitting the neighbourhood of Venusia. I speak ad-
visedly, when I say, that there appears no proof or vestige
of his ever having lived in that country again: a hasty
visit, perhaps, in some year soon after the battle of Philippi,
to settle old accounts, and to see once more the friends of
his youth, seems the only feasible supposition which his own
history of his life and writings will possibly admit.

On this presumption, too, we gain the opportunity for
Horace to have witnessed the manly constancy of Ofellus
under his adverse fortune,

2 S. 11. 114. —-——- videas metato in agello
Cum pecore et gnatis fortem mercede colonum,
Non ego, narrantem .....

and to have derived from Ofellus“s conversation at that
time the materials of his admirable satire, Quae virtus et
quanta, boni, sit vivere parvo, &c- (2 S. 11).

In his boyhood it appears that he had known that para-s
gon of an honest man,

2 S. 1p1. 112. Quo magis his credas; puer hunc ego parvus Ofellum
Integris opibus novi non latius usum,
Quam nunc accisis, δια-ιο ν. 136.

Let us now see what other remarks had occurred tohis
mind, before he left the banks of thc Aufidus, or by what
