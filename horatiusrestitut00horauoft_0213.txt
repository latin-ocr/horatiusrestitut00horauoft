probably, indeed, as in a new school of Latin poetry, they
admired what their predecessore had done or emulated what
their contemporaries were doing.

11. Where the third verse has what may be called the
quinquesyllabic beginning similar to that of the first and
second verses, and sofar most injurious to variety,

1 C. 11. ll ς xV1. 7. Deproeliantes. . . ..’ Non Liber aequ'e. ’

if the modes· of ending it just mentioned are proscribed,
there remains for that purpose only one combination, in a
monosyllabic preceding a trisyllabic word,

Deproeliantes Ι nec cupressi..

Non Liber aeque, Ι 11011 acuta.

But this form of the verse, though made up of ready ma-
terials, (as all later practice shows,) has been sparingly em-
ployed by Horace, only some forty times in all: and whe-
ther stom dislike of the structure itself or from growing pre*
ference for others of a nobler kind, he has admitted verses
so consti-acted, at the rate only of half as often in the two
latter as 111 the two former books of Odes. Is there nothing
supplied by this intel-nal evidence also, in favour of our
general argument?

And here a curious and delicate remark, and one which
seems to have escaped observation‚ remains to be brought
forward.

Horace then never once has engaged the monosyllabic
word in that close union and so far completed sense with the
word eubjoined to it, which this verse from Buchanan ex-
hil-sits.
