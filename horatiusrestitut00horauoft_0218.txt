(194) oN THE METRES OF Holmon.

Under one or other of these six forms as stamped with ¹
Horace's mature approbation, every legitimate third verse
of the Alcaic stanza may now be reduced; and whatever
modes of structure and accentuation differ from these, are
virtually excluded from all place in any classical exercise of
imitative composition.

14. On the Foun'rn line, which has its scansion thus,

-υυ —uu -υ -ῧ

Singularly enough, no scheme of structure likely to be
adopted seems quite objectionable and bad, except that
which exactly coincides with the scansi0n; as it is unfortu-
nately given in that medley of metres‚ known by the name
of Pasiphae,

v. 15. oraque} jungere Ι quae'rit Ι ori...

which, of course, has no parallel in Horace.

The following forms are exhibited in order, according to
their numerical predominance.

The form A. is decidedly the most numerous.
