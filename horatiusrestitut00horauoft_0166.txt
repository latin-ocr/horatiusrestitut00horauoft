On the other hand, with regard to the historica] facts
themselves and the* years of their occurrence, Kirchner
may be generally right: it is not on that ground* perhaps
that any serious objection can be brought against him. His
hastiness in every where assuming the identity of such an
allusion to a foreign name in Hor-ace with such an event or
such a war at such a precise time, this may be regarded as·
the igrzz‘sfatuus, by which he is perpetually led astray in·
venturing to fix the date of each separa-te piece.

Let one instance suffice to exemplify the nature of that
assertion here made: a detailed examination of the whole
would require a volume. Horace, in 3 C. xxrv. addresses

the Roman reader thus,
Intactis opulentior

Thesauris Arabum et divitis Indiae. . .
Therefore, says Kirchner, that Ode must have been·
written before the year Β. c. 24. in which AElius Gallus· is
recorded to have led an expedition into Arabia Felix. That
invasion, however, terminated, we are told, without successg
so t'hat the treasures of Arabia remained as entire and vm-
rffled after that event as they -were before it. Yet on such
a slight and shadowy link of association ‚ as this, Kirchner
does not scruple to hang his hypothesis of the new date‘nacss
28. and. his dislocation of it from Bentley's position at n. c.
24, 23: whereas the very mention of rich, India along with
Arabia's treas-ures (as elsewhere, 1 Ε. v1. 6.) sufficiently
