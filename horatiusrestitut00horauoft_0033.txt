to quote what Klotzius says of him, and Ι say too.''-Dr.
Johnstone's Life and Works of Dr. Parr, Vol. 1. p. 412.

, Let me not be understood, however, as wishing to shelter
myself under authorities like these from the responsibility of
delivering an opinion of my own. From me, the first person
who has ventured to print the books of Horace in the order
ofAtheir original publication, something more in the-direct
way of -reply may naturally be expected; especially as
against Sanadon, who proceeding de novo in 'utter defiance

- The compilers of Horace's life, indeed, in allotting such ‘a

Sanadon's pages might form the labour of a very long life.
A much shorter operation must serve the present purpose.

To disable his judgment, in the phrase of Shakspeare,
may of itself be sufficient. And to that end let the follow-

ing specimens of particular but very gross errors be accepted,
instead of a more general and extensive reply.

(1 .) With Sanadon, the Epodes (of which he discards
the name entirely) are considered as afifth book of odes,-
