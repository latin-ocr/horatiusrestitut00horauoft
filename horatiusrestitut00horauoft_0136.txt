of many topics variously calculated to illustrate the m‘erits
of the one and the gratitude of the other.

Singularly enough, the first mention in point of time
perhaps, which the pen of Horace has left of Maecenas, and
certainly the very last 'fintroduction of his name, (to say
nothing of 2 C. xvn. Cur* me querelis . .. and of all the
intermediate demonstrations,) bear striking testimony to the
early and late affection, which united the Patron to the
Poet on terms of the most familiar attachment.

Thus, iu 1 S. 111. Omnibus hoc vitium est. . . Horace has
to display the perverseness with which an uncandid con-
struction of character is too often indulged3 and he exem-
plifies in his own case the offence which persons, less genereus
and less judicious than Maecenas, would have taken at such
freedom as the Statesman when interrupted bore with perfect

obtulerim tibi, Maecenas, ut forte legentem
Aut tacitum impellat quovis sermone molestus ἓ

friendship begun in such a spirit, and at a period of his
writings (P. D.) when new topics for direct address could
hardly be expected, Horace thus beautifully and not the
less so for the oblique way of introducing it, in the Ode to
Phyllis, marks the celebration of Maecenas's birth-day.
