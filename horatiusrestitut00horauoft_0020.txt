those two Letters of advice with such masterly skill and
such beautiful execution.

Before concluding, it is incumbent on me to acknowledge,
with many thanks, the valuable assistance which I received
in the summer of last year, when at Richmond‚ from the*
fine taste and talent of Mr. William King, in very carefully
drawing up the principal articles of AppendiX. Mr. King
is already known, I trust, from the just compliments
paid to him as my coadjutor in editing the Analecta Ma-
jora Poetica of Professor Dalzel in 1827 3 and he well de-
serves to be known from his labour so judiciously bestowed
on the last edition of Mitford's History of Greece.

Nor may the valuable services of Mr. Robert Baldwin
be allowed here to pass unacknowledged. Witho'ut his*
friendly assistance and judicious advice, these sheets could
never have been carried through the press; under tlie‘
peculiar difficulty of so many MS. additions and correo-³
tions to be incorporated with the old text, and the diffi·
culty itself aggravated by that text being so singular a
compound of original matter blended with quotation.
