amenity, and pathos, and fine imagination.

If therefore any juxta-position of Odes preserved in all
MSS. and editions, might command reverence from an editor
'of Horace3 Odes like these six could not possibly suffer
violation by being torn asunder. Sanadon disjoins these
six Alcaic Odes from one another entirely, and has not left
even any two of them in any connection or contiguity
whatsoever!

(vid.''1’reatise on Metres, No. x1X.), that in the thirdline

he vigilantly ever after guarded the third line, the key-stone
of the Alcaic stama, against modes of structure, which his
improved sense of harmony condemned. Briefly to place
the matter in the strongest light, no other hypothesis will

1 In this nice predicament, what part does Sanadon play ?
The truth is, that such exactness of metrical observation was
unknown in his time: and we must aequit him on the charge
·of neglecting distinctions, not then brought into notice.
:But forall that excuse, the main ground of conviction re-
mains the same. Sanadon, in his Nouvelle distribution,
