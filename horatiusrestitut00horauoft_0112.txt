‚Horace was born. V

“ The vicissitude which placed aPriest on the throne of the
Caesars, has ordained that a Bull of Pope Pascal the Second
should be the decisive document in ascertaining the site of
a fountain which inspired an Ode of Horace.”

About so minute a concern long disquisitione here would
be tedious and unnecessary. For in the first place, Mr.
Dunlop’s solution (History of Roman Literature. 1828.
Vol. 111. p. 213.) seems calculated to set the matter at rest
very easily. .

“ The probability is, that Horace had named the clearest
and loveliest stream of his Sabine retreat, after that fountain
which lay in Apulia, and on the brink of which he had no
doubt often sported in' infancy.''

And secondly, in confirmation of Mr. Dunlop's conjec-

ture, I may be forgiven for inserting part of a Letter of my ·

own on this very point of difficulty, familiarly written in the
year 1824.

, “ Let the Fons Bandusiae (now the Fonte Bello) of the
Sabine valley, flow on with all its honours!

“For as to the Ode of Horace (3 C. x111.), it tallies
admirably with the idea of his christening what had no
name before, after the romantic spring, which had a name,
not far from Venusia, and which he had loved when a
child.''

you may perhaps gather that this fountain had no namo
whatever, till Horace gave it one. The rivus lower down
was certainly called Diqentia‚ now Licenza.
